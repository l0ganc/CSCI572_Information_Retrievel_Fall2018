By Carolyn Hax | 
October 1, 2018 at 6:00 am


DEAR CAROLYN: When my girlfriend “Claire” and I moved in together, we split the chores down the middle. It seemed fair to me at the time but — despite rejigs to the list — Claire always seems to feel shortchanged. She says it isn’t fair that she has chores she hates (laundry) while I do stuff (cooking) I enjoy.

I’m the oldest of six siblings, and I don’t really hate any basic domestic tasks. Even cleaning toilets isn’t that bad: two people, a lot less horrifying than eight.

 Claire has now tried to ban me from listening to music while I clean, and gets frustrated if I don’t clean up to the schedule she has in her head. For example, I vacuum once a week, on Friday, unless something gets spilled or someone is coming over. Once I put it off for a couple of days because I was sick as a dog, and now she won’t let it go and harps on about it if I don’t start cleaning the minute I get in the door.
At this point I feel like she’s a client more than a girlfriend, and I’d break up with any client who seemed this impossible to please.

However, before this we got on really well and this is the first time I’ve lived with a significant other — after growing up in an eight-person house I appreciated my freedom — so maybe I’m being unreasonable? Maybe I should pretend to hate dusting? Or plant things in the garden since I really do hate gardening. (Bugs! Worms! Stuff under your nails.)

Unreasonable?

DEAR UNREASONABLE: For the sake of argument, let’s assume  “Claire” is a wonderful person with some legitimate household grievance that she just hasn’t been able to articulate, and therefore is putting her anger into whatever option presents itself.

Now, the argument: There comes a point where it doesn’t matter how wonderful a person is or how legitimate her grievances are because her response to them becomes too petty and despicable to explain away. “Claire has now tried to ban me from listening to music while I clean”? Because it cuts into what she sees as the required amount of suffering for your home?

Run, run, run — and not the vacuum.

					
				

Life provides enough hard work. You don’t need to date it.

DEAR CAROLYN:

Re: Unreasonable

Claire would rather see you miserable than happy. Just let that sink in for a minute. What does that say about the future of your mental health in this relationship?

DEAR CAROLYN:

Re: Unreasonable

Are any of your siblings single men who also don’t mind cleaning and would like to come live at my house?

DEAR CAROLYN:

Re: Unreasonable

My son was in a marriage like this. His wife’s role was to make sure he was punished for … I have no idea, but she made all of our lives miserable. Please, please. This man has to leave the relationship right now, today, this minute, and never, ever look back.

Miserable

DEAR MISERABLE: Ever. Thank you.

	Unions prepare to lose in the courthouse and strike back in the statehouse

The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on a high-profile case that could slash the power of public-employee unions. But California labor leaders are already planning to push for new state laws to blunt the impact of an unfavorable ruling.
The case argued before the court last week, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, challenges whether public-employee unions can collect fees from workers who choose not to join the union. California is one of several states that allow unions to collect so-called “fair share fees” from workers who benefit from services such as contract negotiations but don’t want to pay for their union’s political activity.
Plaintiff Mark Janus, a state child support specialist in Illinois, contends that all union activity is political when the workers’ boss is the government. He argues that requiring him to pay the fee infringes on his constitutional rights to free speech and association by essentially forcing him to support a group that advocates positions with which he disagrees — in particular, its push for boosting worker salaries in a state facing a budget crisis after reportedly mismanaging its pension program.


AFSCME, the nation’s largest union of government workers, argues that without the fees workers would get a “free ride,” enjoying job protections the union secures without paying the associated cost. In a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of California, the state’s Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra argues that changing the status quo would unnecessarily disrupt California’s dealings with its public-employee unions.
The court is likely to rule this spring, and given its conservative majority, many observers expect the unions to lose. That would slash the amount of money public-employee unions can collect from their workers — and, over time, could shrink membership. Those changes would shake up politics in California, where organized labor has long enjoyed enormous clout in a state dominated by Democrats. The Janus case is backed by a network of conservative groups whose funders also support Republican candidates.
“The threat to organized labor is a threat to all of us, in particular to the Democratic party,” Alma Hernandez, executive director of the Service Employees International Union in California, said to a roomful of union activists at the California Democratic Party convention. The mood was a mix of doom and defiance.
“And make no mistake about it, brothers and sisters, they’re coming after us.”
Predicting they will lose in the courthouse, California union leaders have begun fighting back in the statehouse. Last year, they successfully lobbied for a new state law that requires government workers, upon being hired, to go through an orientation session with union representatives.
“That is going to be a great boost to allow us to at least access the people and ask them to join,” said Dave Low, executive director of the California School Employees Association. “Once Janus is decided, and we feel very much that it is going to be decided against us, we will be moving other legislation.”
The legislation is in early conceptual stages and it’s too soon to say whether, if approved, it would cover all unions or just those in the public sector. But union-backed bills under consideration, Low said, include:
	giving union members “release time” from their jobs so they can recruit other workers to join the union
	shielding union members’ contact information from the public to make it harder for anti-union groups to reach them
	allowing unions to charge non-members who use services such as arbitration or a labor representative to help them through a disciplinary process


Taxpayer advocates would likely oppose bills that would shield contact information or give union members release time from work, said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. But overall, he said, a court ruling in favor of Janus could relieve some pressure on California taxpayers.
“It will perhaps result in our elected officials being able to pursue policies that have more the public in mind, and not just the public employees,” Coupal said. “They will be less likely to cave to public employees in collective bargaining in terms of salary and compensation.”
Labor unions are a major influence in California’s Capitol, spending money to help elect Democrats and then lobbying them to pass new laws. In just the past few years, unions here have successfully advocated for laws granting overtime to farmworkers, making paid sick days mandatory and increasing the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. Labor has shaped many other decisions in the Capitol, from which car companies can get electric-vehicle rebates to how much money school districts can hold in reserves.
That kind of influence is costly. Labor unions spent at least $16.3 million lobbying the California Legislature last year and, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, more than $123 million on California political campaigns in the last election cycle — money that comes from dues paid by union members.
About 2.5 million public- and private-sector workers in California are union members, according to the California Labor Federation, and another 110,000 government workers here pay fair-share fees to unions they choose not to join.

An unfavorable ruling from the Supreme Court could diminish union membership in California by between 5 and 30 percent, depending on what other laws are in place, predicted California Labor Federation spokesman Steve Smith. It’s unlikely to strike an immediate blow to how much unions spend on political campaigns in California this year, he said, though it could have some impact. The real change will be felt over time: If the ruling leads to a decline in membership, unions will have less money to spend on politics.
“If we have less money as labor, we’re going to be spending less money on Democratic candidates, we’re going to be spending less money on things like ballot initiatives,” said Jessica Ulstad, political field director for the California Federation of Teachers.
“We will all have to look at our budgets and say, ‘What is it that we absolutely are going to spend money on, and what are we not going to be able to do anymore?’ ”

Defying the Trump administration on climate change, California’s air-pollution agency ruled Friday that automakers must comply with the state’s strict rules on greenhouse gases if they want to continue selling cars here.

The California Air Resources Board approved a regulation that will significantly curtail carbon spewed by new cars sold in the state, beginning in 2021.

The board’s vote is likely to intensify the state’s conflict with the Trump administration over greenhouse gases from cars, a fight that’s been brewing since shortly after President Donald Trump took office.

In August, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency said it plans to relax the standards on tailpipe emissions — and force California to accept the new national regulations. California has vowed to fight the EPA’s plan, in court if necessary, and Friday’s vote is intended to solidify the state’s opposition to the Trump regulations.

“This is California girding for that battle,” said Deborah Sivas, an environmental law professor at Stanford University.

Automakers, who say dealing with multiple standards would be a logistical nightmare, urged the Air Resources Board to postpone the decision while the state is still talking to the Trump administration about a compromise. Friday’s vote “could lock the state into a position that would make further negotiations with the federal administration impossible,” the Association of Global Automakers said in written testimony to the board.

But California officials urged on by representatives of seven states that have aligned themselves with California, were in no mood to back down. Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols said the state remains willing to talk with the Trump administration but so far is being ignored.

“They do not see us as a partner or a collaborator in this process,” Nichols said.

Board member Hector De La Torre, a former assemblyman, added: “We have rights and we’re going to exercise those rights to the hilt.” He also scolded automakers for asking the Trump administration to roll back the standards in the first place.

					
				

The EPA says relaxing the rules will save car buyers an average of $1,850 on every new vehicle purchased. Yet California officials and environmentalists say greener cars, despite their higher sticker prices, more than pay for themselves because of dramatic improvements in fuel mileage. As a practical matter, the most effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars is by making lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles.

Tailpipe emissions account for about 28 percent of all greenhouse gases, according to the Air Resources Board. Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration has made fighting climate change a signature environmental issue, and the air board said allowing Trump’s plan to take effect would put millions of extra tons of carbon into the air.

The Trump administration, however, said the increased carbon emissions would be minimal — and wouldn’t matter in the scheme of things. A draft environmental impact statement by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is working with the EPA on the standards, says temperatures will rise 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century regardless of what happens to tailpipe emissions, the Washington Post reported Friday. That’s considerably higher than many scientists have projected and could exacerbate the impacts of climate change.

The fight between Sacramento and Washington revolves around a complicated agreement struck early in the Obama administration. Starting in 2009, the state and federal governments essentially compromised on regulations to gradually scale back carbon emissions, year by year, on new cars.

Despite the compromise, California also retained the right to impose more stringent rules — a right it has under the federal Clean Air Act because of the state’s historically bad pollution.

It took this step because there were minor differences between the state and federal greenhouse gas regulations. Even so, the state agreed that any automaker that followed the Obama administration’s regulations on greenhouse gases would be “deemed to comply” with California’s rules.

Now the Trump administration is derailing the compromise. Not only is it planning to relax the federal greenhouse-gas restrictions, it announced in August it expects to revoke California’s right to enforce its rules within its borders. The Trump administration won’t finalize the new regulations until later this year.

The rules currently in effect, in California and nationwide, would reduce tailpipe carbon emissions about roughly one third over the next seven years. They would also increase fuel efficiencies from an average of about 35 miles per gallon to more than 54 mpg. The Trump plan announced in August would raise average fuel economy standards to an average of about 37 mpg.

By revoking California’s special rights under the Clean Air Act, the Trump administration is also going after the state’s “advanced clean car” regulations. Those regulations require automakers to dramatically increase the number of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids they sell in California — from about 420,000 today to 1 million in 2025
The EPA said the mandate is unfair because automakers are raising prices of traditional vehicles in an effort to subsidize costs of the advanced cars, which are more costly and less popular.

By Kerry Crowley | kcrowley@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: October 4, 2018 at 12:56 pm | UPDATED: October 4, 2018 at 4:51 pm


SAN FRANCISCO–Regardless of who the Giants hire to overhaul the team’s roster this offseason, significant changes are in order. 

An offense responsible for one of the worst seasons in franchise history needs more youth, power and athleticism while a pitching staff loaded down by bloated contracts could use a few more arms at bargain prices. 

 
Reshaping the core of the club is a difficult challenge made more complicated by the dynamics of the roster. Several high-profile players possess no-trade clauses and are under contract for at least the next two seasons while only four members of the 2018 team are free agents. 

Pitcher Derek Holland, catcher Nick Hundley and outfielders Hunter Pence and Gregor Blanco are all free to pursue opportunities on the open market this winter, but at least two of the outgoing free agents could provide value to next year’s roster and are candidates to re-sign. 



After the Giants lost starters Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija to injury this summer, Holland emerged as a stabilizing force in the team’s rotation. A year after flaming out with the Chicago White Sox, Holland revived his career in San Francisco and posted a 2.87 ERA in 25 games after May 1. 

Holland is likely hoping his efforts yield multi-year offers, but after staying under the luxury tax threshold in 2018, the Giants may feel comfortable extending the left-hander a two-year deal with a reasonable average annual salary. 

A starter who ultimately proved reliable as a swingman, Holland has expressed a desire to return to the Giants even after enduring a losing season. Hundley was around for both 2017 and 2018, but after the final game of the year, he also showed an interest in returning to the club for one more season. 

“The team that we put out there, if we’re healthy, it’s a team that’s capable of winning the World Series,” Hundley said. “So if I’m able to add to that, I definitely would enjoy that opportunity.” 

Hundley’s potential return is more complicated than Holland’s, as the Giants will head into next year with a level of uncertainty at the catcher position. After undergoing hip surgery in August, Buster Posey hopes to be ready to catch by Opening Day, but the Giants won’t have clarity on the situation until at least the middle of spring. Rookie Aramis Garcia surprised manager Bruce Bochy and others within the organization during a strong September, but there’s a question as to whether Garcia is ready to handle a full-time backup role. 

					
				

“This is a good chance to see what he is about,” Bochy said Sunday. “This kid has shown a lot. He’s shown toughness and his ability to handle major league pitching. So that will be a tough decision in his development.” 

The Giants could re-sign Hundley to a one-year deal as insurance behind Posey, but doing so may limit the team’s opportunity to develop Garcia, who could be challenged for playing time as soon as 2020 by No. 2 overall draft choice Joey Bart. 

Garcia’s versatility and ability to play first base is a bonus for the Giants, who kept Blanco on the Opening Day roster because of his experience handling all three outfield positions. After spending a three-month chunk of the year at Triple-A Sacramento, Blanco has indicated he would like to continue playing but has also quietly expressed interest in coaching if he can’t secure a contract.

If Blanco does ink another minor league deal, it will likely be the last of his career and come with another franchise. If he opts to retire and coach, the 34-year-old has many fans in the Giants’ organization. 

“You get to this point in your career and sure, it crosses your mind and what a great coach he would make,” Bochy said Friday. “You guys know him, what a great person, positive, knows the game, being a role player and a starter, he would make an outstanding coach.” 

The final free agent, Pence, has already begun training for the 2019 season in hopes he can reset his career in the same manner Holland did this year. The Giants celebrated the end of Pence’s six-plus year tenure in San Francisco with an emotional tribute on the final day of the regular season, but Pence plans on tinkering with his swing, proving himself in winter ball and attempting to latch on with a club next spring. 

“Hopefully I can reinvent myself and come back and produce on the field,” Pence said. “Because I definitely feel I have the strength. My body is healthy and I absolutely have the love and the joy for the game so I’m going to try to do that.” 

Though Pence hasn’t closed the door on a potential reunion with the Giants, a new general manager is unlikely to extend an invitation to spring training.

						Space X successfully deployed a Telstar 18 VANTAGE communications satellite into orbit late Sunday (early Monday, Florida time). SpaceX said that on Monday it will announce who will be its first civilian traveler on a voyage to the moon.

Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and 22 other Americans have been to the moon.

On Monday, we’ll find out who SpaceX intends to make lunar visitor No. 25.

SpaceX, the other major company run by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, said late Thursday it has signed up the world’s first private passenger to fly around the moon, and it will make that person’s identity public Monday at 6 p.m. Pacific. SpaceX made the announcement on its own website, but also in a manner very familiar to Musk, via Twitter.

“SpaceX has signed the world’s first private passenger to fly around the Moon aboard our BFR launch vehicle—an important step toward enabling access for everyday people who dream of traveling to space. Find out who’s flying and why on Monday, September 17.” SpaceX tweeted.

The BFR, which officially stands for Big Falcon Rocket–or, as it is jokingly referred to, Big (expletive) Rocket–is a Saturn 5 Class reusable rocket about which little is known, aside from the fact that it is big. Musk has also touted it as a central part of his plan for humans to eventually travel to Mars.
In addition to naming SpaceX’s first passenger to the moon, Musk is expected to give more details about the time frame for the eventual, nearly 500,000-mile round trip to the moon and back. If the voyage comes to pass, it will be the first time any humans have been to the moon since Gene Cernan, Ronald Evans and Harrison Schmitt flew to the moon on Apollo 17 in December 1972.

	SAN FRANCISCO — A federal grand jury has indicted a 51-year-old San Francisco man for allegedly robbing three Bay Area banks.
Timothy Wayne Phillips is charged with three counts of bank robbery and one count of attempted robbery. If convicted, Phillips faces up to 20 years in prison for each charge.
The first of the three heists occurred at a U.S. Bank in San Bruno on Aug. 29. The second took place at a Wells Fargo in San Francisco on Sept. 6 and the third at a Wells Fargo in Berkeley on Sept. 7.


Prosecutors said Phillips managed to steal a grand total of $7,335.90.
The attempted bank robbery occurred at a City National Bank in Walnut Creek on Sept. 7.
Phillips remains in federal custody and is scheduled to be arraigned in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Oct. 4.

If you find yourself on Highway 580, heading east towards Altamont Pass, be sure to make a stop in Livermore, which is home to several outstanding breweries. The newest is the year-old, family-friendly Shadow Puppet. Yes, you can bring the kids — this brewery has a small dedicated playroom for the young ones.

While many craft breweries concentrate on the production end and relegate the tasting experience to a warehouse corner, Brian Blackburn’s Shadow Puppet puts lots of emphasis on the tasting room. The result is a large and very comfortable space, with 17 beers on tap.

Shadow Puppet’s brewers are clearly having fun. It’s evident in the wide variety of styles they brew. On the day I visited, the tap offerings included a Guava Berliner Weisse, an IPA made with spruce tips, a prickly pear cream ale, a cranberry hefeweizen and a coconut Baltic porter that was one of my favorites. More mainstream varieties were also available, including three more IPAs, as well as a pale, a blonde, a red and an amber ale.  When you experiment as much as these guys do, one expects to find a few duds in the brew mix, but that was not the case here. Every beer I tried was eminently drinkable, and some were really outstanding.

The tasting room offers plenty of tables, chairs and couches, with ample room to relax. You’ll find a food truck on site several days a week, plus snacks — chips, salsa, guacamole, jerky and nuts — for sale in the tasting room proper. Enjoy beer by the glass ($6 to $7) or sample a taster flight — four 4-ounce beers are $8, six are $12.

Don’t miss: The delicious Contorsion Mexicano is a variation on Shadow Puppet’s Contortion Milk Stout. It’s infused with cacao nibs and chiles, producing a roasty, chocolaty libation with just the right amount of heat. Many brewers go overboard when they use chile peppers, but this one is nicely balanced and very flavorful.
Details: Open 4 to 8 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 12 to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 12 to 7 p.m. Sunday at 4771B Arroyo Vista, Livermore; www.shadowpuppetbrewing.com.

By Judith Martin, Nicholas Ivor Martin and Jacobina Martin | United Feature Syndicate
PUBLISHED: September 22, 2018 at 6:00 am | UPDATED: September 23, 2018 at 5:12 am


DEAR MISS MANNERS: I am a single mother and am experienced in different types of home repair. Yet at large family gatherings, at least one male relative always boldly announces to the gathering that he is going to help me in some way.

Judith Martin 
They don’t tell me this privately; this is a sweeping declaration. The gathering then comments on their kindness and what good people they are. I have never asked, or even hinted, that I would like this help.

Miss Manners, these declarations are annoying for two reasons. First, they are rarely acted upon. Even a gentle follow-up asking when I could take them up on the offer is put off to “sometime.” The second is that the few times they do come out, it ends up being a disaster for me. Each time, they have left the situation worse.

The understanding is that I will pay for any parts needed. That is reasonable, except that they buy incorrect or unnecessary parts. They eat all my food, ask for constant affirmation, and leave a huge mess.

Each time, I have had to hire someone else to redo their work. In most of these situations, I could have fixed the problem myself quicker, cheaper and better.

These grand statements are made for their own gratification. How do I respond without coming across as an ungrateful bore? I do not like to call people out in front of others. In past years, I have just swallowed my words and sat silently. I have simply absorbed the expense in the name of family peace, or rested in knowing they would never come. Is there a gracious response I can employ?

GENTLE READER: “Thank you, but actually, I’m pretty good at most household repairs. I’ll call you if I need help, but in the meantime, please call me if YOU do.”

DEAR MISS MANNERS: When congratulating someone for winning an award or getting a position, what is the time frame for doing so without it being an afterthought? When has too much time passed?

GENTLE READER: Nowadays, when awards are being revoked for bad behavior, Miss Manners considers it wise to act quickly.

					
				

DEAR MISS MANNERS: My husband and I recently dined at our favorite restaurant, which has undergone an update of the decor, including new plates that are slightly scooped. Said plates are lovely and add a modern flair.

However, if one needs to rest a knife or fork on the edge of the plate, it is impossible. The utensil either slides onto the table or into the food.

What does one do when you must put down a utensil or two to pass the rolls?

GENTLE READER: Get the tablecloth dirty.

Miss Manners is not saying this is your best practice, but she also does not see another option. When the server comes around to collect your plate, you may say, “I am so sorry for the stains, but our plates, while beautiful, seem to have trouble holding our utensils.” With copious amounts of dirty laundry, the restaurant may find that they are due for yet another update in decor.

PUBLISHED: October 11, 2017 at 10:50 am | UPDATED: October 11, 2017 at 11:00 am


In minutes a Santa Rosa man went from sleeping in his bed to evading a fiery blaze.

Travis Hann and his family escaped the wildfires that have devastated Northern California. In a video uploaded to Hann’s YouTube channel, Hann films the exact moment when he and his family escaped their home in the Mark West Springs area.

In the video, Hann is seen driving through heavy winds and a street consumed by flames.
Hann is one of the thousands who was forced to leave the area late Sunday night and early Monday morning because of the fires.

Officials said the death toll has risen to at least 15 people in the multi-county fire and at least 3,500 homes and businesses have been destroyed.

Hanno said he and his family are safe but believes their home is lost in the fire. As of Tuesday evening, he has not been able to return to see the extent of the damage.

						BOSTON, MA – APRIL 21:  A young fan wearing a David Price #24 shirt sits in the Green Monster seats before the Boston Red Sox take on the Tampa Bay Rays at Fenway Park on April 21, 2016 in Boston, Massachusetts.  (Photo by Adam Glanzman/Getty Images)		
	
By Gary Peterson | gpeterson@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: September 20, 2018 at 12:45 pm | UPDATED: September 21, 2018 at 4:35 am


Two Boston-area men who unaccountably found themselves in possession of a championship banner the Red Sox hadn’t yet earned, learned a valuable lesson this week: There’s no extortion in baseball.

The men, Louie Iacuzzi and James Amaral, claim to have seen the banner lying on the highway while they were driving Monday morning. (It’s unknown if they were coming from or going to Cheers.) They scooped it up and took it home. It was then they realized it was a banner celebrating the Red Sox’s 2018 division title — which hadn’t been clinched as of Wednesday, but will be soon.

Recounting the stunning turn of events, Amaral said, “This is from Fenway Pahhhhhk! How do we have this? Nobody made this. It belongs to the Pahhhhhk!” Hear for yourself. Take it from one who knows, it’s as entertaining the 37th time as it is the first:



The men hatched a plan apparently based loosely on the Finders Keepers statute. They agreed the Red Sox were entitled to the banner. And they decided they were due a little “reciprocation” for their trouble. “We’re looking for something,” Amaral said. “We don’t want to just hand it over. We need to negotiate here.”

Before you rush to characterize these gentlemen as just a coupla guys oblivious to the fact that they are being swept up in forces larger than themselves, recall that Pablo Sandoval negotiated $95 million from Red Sox management just a few years back. And he didn’t even have a banner as collateral.
Alas, the men turned over the banner to the Red Sox on Wednesday. The Boston Globe reported they walked away empty-handed. As far as anyone knows, they’re off to their next great adventure.

			Injuries to George Kittle and Garrett Celek prompted the 49ers to promote tight end Ross Dwelley from the practice squad, which might be seen as a positive in that they didn't need to promote a running back to replace Matt Breida.

	Liam Hendriks transforms from A’s castoff to starter vs Yankees in Wild Card Game

NEW YORK — The A’s making history by becoming the first club to ever try “bullpenning” in the playoffs isn’t even the craziest part about the whole thing. That distinction belongs to the man actually starting the game.
A’s reliever Liam Hendriks will open up Wednesday night’s wild-card game, opposing Yankees starter Luis Severino.


Tasked with getting through a clean first inning at Yankee Stadium is the same Hendriks who was designated for assignment by the A’s back in June after an injury-riddled first couple of months ballooned his ERA up to 7.36 over 13 outings before getting cut. The guy who whose fastball, which sat around 91-92 mph, was getting crushed on a regular basis.

DFA’d for the fifth time in his career, Hendriks, 29, was unsure if he’d even pitch again for the A’s. Now, he’ll face a top of the Yankees lineup that will likely feature names like Andrew McCutchen, Aaron Judge, and Giancarlo Stanton.
“I’m just happy to be on the team, to be honest,” Hendriks said. “It was a trying year regardless of everything else. But it’s one of those things where I’ve had to adapt, I’ve had to overcome some things this year, and I think it’s made me better. It’s definitely humbled me, it’s definitely brought me back down to earth, and it’s definitely brought out that little animosity about everything, just trying to go out there and prove that I can do this.”
It’s a role Hendriks has had some practice in.
Though he did not have a single win to his credit and a 4.13 ERA over 25 games, Hendriks’ recent outings as a starter tell a much different story.
Eight times he took the ball in the first inning for the A’s in September, and though they went 4-4 in those games, none of the losses were on Hendriks. All eight opening frames, he kept the opposing team off the scoreboard.
The stakes are obviously much higher this time around, but Hendriks can look back on those successful eight games as comfort.
What also makes Hendriks a strong choice for the role is that he’s about as loose as a baseball player gets. He spent a good portion of his press conference Tuesday cracking jokes and talking about his visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, excited to speak on his love for a medieval armor exhibit.
Hendriks feels no pressure, which is exactly the type of pitcher you want heading into such a pressure-filled game.
“There’s no difference in the game,” Hendriks said. “Obviously it’s a do or die, but to everybody out there, it’s the same strike zone, same guys in the box, just going to go out there and do it and see how it goes.”
The feeling of no pressure might just be a result of getting humbled by a minor league stint at Triple-A. A’s manager Bob Melvin said the demotion was a “wake-up” call for Hendriks. The right-hander went down to Nashville, revamped his entire throwing program as he incorporated more long tossing, and ended up bumping the velocity on his fastball to around 97 mph to go 4-1 with a 2.84 ERA and 43 strikeouts over 25 1/3 innings at Triple-A.
Hendriks’ big league career was on death’s doorstep, and instead of succumbing to the grim reaper, he overcame adversity and finds himself in a position his manager would never have thought in his wildest dreams he’d be in come October.
“He’s maybe a little bit more focused in what he’s doing now, and the results speak for themselves,” Melvin said. “It’s been nice to see a guy that was in that position come back and have the type of success he has had for us.”

The plan for the rest of the game following Hendriks is still unclear.
“There are a lot of moving parts,” Melvin said. “I can tell you we’ll have 11 pitchers. How it’s going to go after Liam, we’re still kind of deciding who may be the last guy on the 11 pitchers. So I’ll probably withhold that at this point.”

Californians should tell the president to stop using Title X to attack Planned Parenthood’s services

						President Trump is proposing a rule that would prohibit doctors who receive Title X funding from referring patients to abortion providers.		
	
By Mercury News & East Bay Times Editorial Boards | 
PUBLISHED: July 20, 2018 at 6:15 am | UPDATED: July 20, 2018 at 9:25 am


Donald Trump is one of the last people who should be offering women advice on, well, anything. But it’s especially true when it comes to family planning issues.

It’s appalling that this president wants to strip Title X federal funding from family planning clinics that provide abortions or refer patients to places that do. The direct attack on Planned Parenthood will have a negative impact on 850,000 women throughout California, most of whom are low-income and do not have the resources to go elsewhere.

The Trump administration proposed the new rule in May. Californians should flood the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website with their responses before the July 31 deadline for public comment.

The beauty of the Title X program is this: Congress recognized in 1970 that millions of women did not have the resources to access family planning services and other essential health care. Title X makes that possible. Nearly two-thirds of the 4 million people receiving services provided by Title X funds have incomes that place them below the federal poverty line.

It’s important to understand that no Title X funds go to provide abortions. Here’s what the $286 million in funding does fund: breast and cervical cancer detection, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV testing and contraception.

The program gets results. The government estimates it helps prevent nearly 2 million unintended pregnancies every year that statistics show would have led some 275,000 women to seek abortions. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that for every dollar invested in family planning, taxpayers save $7, or roughly $13 billion a year.

Closer to home, Title X funds provide 20 percent of the funds for Planned Parenthood Mar Monte’s 35 clinics, including 12 in Alameda, Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. That includes outreach and comprehensive sex-education presentations at homeless shelters run by Life Moves, the Santa Clara County Juvenile Hall and through The Hub to foster youth

The Trump administration is using Title X to attack Planned Parenthood because a small percentage of Planned Parenthood’s services — 3 percent — go to providing abortions.

					
				

The president likely has no idea that Planned Parenthood Mar Monte alone schedules about 8,000 health care visits per week in Northern California and Nevada. If its funding goes away, more than 240,000 patients would lose access to this type of preventive health care, the kind that saves vast amounts of public money.

Planned Parenthood doesn’t deserve the Trump administration attacks.

Planned Parenthood is in large part directly responsible for the fact that the teenage pregnancy rate in the United States has been steadily declining for the past three decades. Family planning education and birth control work — giving young women opportunities they need to obtain high school, and college and graduate degrees, leading to higher, steadier incomes and greater financial independence.

If Trump wants to improve the lives of women in the United States, he should be offering more funding to Title X programs, not threatening to take critical health care services.

	Hotline newsletter: L.A. judge invalidates NCAA’s show-cause penalty, USC and the conference’s playoff key

		
	Jon Wilner
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 10, 2018 at 11:00 am | UPDATED: October 13, 2018 at 12:07 pm

	  
		Categories:
		College Sports, Sports	



	* The Pac-12 Hotline newsletter is published each Monday-Wednesday-Friday during the college sports season (and twice-a-week in the summer). This edition, from Oct. 10, has been made available in archived form …


The NCAA rulebook is dead in California (or something like that)
What was the Pac-8 became the Pac-10 and then the Pac-12. Could the conference return to its original size in the not-so-distant future?
If a declaration by commissioner Larry Scott is to be believed, then a judge’s decision Tuesday to invalidate a slice of the NCAA rulebook could force the California schools to bolt the conference they’ve called home for forever.


The judge, however, didn’t buy Scott’s declaration. We don’t buy it, either, and assume it was intended as legal posturing on behalf of the NCAA and not a realistic portrayal of nuclear winter in the Pac-12.
Scott’s statement and L.A. Superior Court Judge Frederick Shaller’s decision all stem from the defamation lawsuit filed against the NCAA by former USC assistant Todd McNair for penalties assessed in the Reggie Bush transgressions.
A jury decided against McNair last spring, but Shaller issued a tentative ruling on a specific matter in the case: The ‘show-cause’ penalty slapped on McNair violated state law.
In simplified terms, the show-cause penalty requires a school to make the case that it shouldn’t be penalized by the NCAA for hiring a coach with major violations on his resume. Essentially, it casts the coach into the wilderness — unless, like Chip Kelly, the coach heads to the NFL — and is one of the prized hammers in the NCAA’s system of justice.
(As USC fans know well, that system lacks a moral core.)
After Shaller’s tentative ruling, Scott submitted a declaration to the court that stated, per ESPN:
“If California law prevents institutions in that state from honoring such commitments, it is hard to see how the Pac-12’s Member Universities in California could continue to meet the requirements of NCAA membership. Thus, the Court’s tentative ruling would place at risk the competitive and scholarship opportunities that flow from NCAA participation for the Pac-12’s California Member Universities. It is unclear how the Pac-12 could function with a third of its members unable to meet all requirements of NCAA membership.”
As ESPN noted: Scott was under no legal obligation to offer his opinion. And Shaller wasn’t interested. He ruled that the NCAA’s show-cause penalty “an unlawful restraint” and said of Scott’s declaration, per the L.A. Times:
“The opinions of these two witnesses” — Scott and Big West commissioner Dennis Farrell — “are completely speculative and irrelevant to the issue … The proposed testimony of Scott and Farrell is deemed inadmissible and is not considered.”
Where does it stand? Are the California schools in danger of being forced to leave the conference? No, no, no.
The NCAA will undoubtedly appeal. And even if Shaller’s ruling is upheld, the voiding of a single punitive measure in the association’s disciplinary arsenal won’t lead to the California school leaving the conference. Although some USC fans would probably prefer that outcome. — Jon Wilner


Hot off the Hotline

• The key to the Pac-12’s playoff push could be USC. That’s right: The conference might need the Trojans to derail Notre Dame in order to clear a path for its one-loss champ. That and more in the latest bowl projections.
• Meanwhile, basketball season is fast approaching and my preseason media ballot was published Tuesday morning. UCLA and Oregon look to be the best teams, but a case could be made for any of nine to finish on the top tier.
• The newsletter is now available in archival form in its entirety (all the links to Hotline content and articles from other sources). Previous editions will be posted regularly. Here’s the hashtag: https://www.mercurynews.com/tag/pac-12-hotline-newsletter/
Why we need your support: Like so many other providers of local journalism across the country, the Hotline’s parent website, mercurynews.com, recently moved to a subscription model. A few Hotline stories will remain free each month (as will this newsletter), but for access to all content, you’ll need to subscribe at a rate of just 12 cents per day for 12 months. And thanks for your loyalty.


State of Affairs
Perspective on the conference from beyond its borders …
• “Why has the Pac-12 fallen behind the other Power 5 conferences?” is the main mailbag question this week for Stewart Mandel, editor-in-chief of the The Athletic’s college football site. His explanation focuses not on the Pac-12 Networks’ struggles or the expanding revenue gap. “In any conference, the strength of the league starts with the head coaching lineup.” So true. And on the west coast, that lineup has undergone considerable transition in recent years.


In the news

(Note: The Hotline newsletter includes links to sites that could require a subscription once the number of free views has been reached.)
• Washington State president Kirk Schulz is the new Pac-12 representative to the College Football Playoff’s board of managers, which oversees all governance of the event.
• Oregon is urging fans to prioritize civility against their arch enemy Saturday in Autzen Stadium. Let’s hope nobody drops to the level we saw from a handful of fans after the Stanford game.
• The showdown in Eugene matches the conference’s best defense (Washington) against its best offense (Oregon). In our view, that means the outcome likely hinges on how well the Huskies’ offense fares against the Ducks’ defense.
• As the national media focuses its attention on Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault, the playmaker vows: “I’m just going to keep doing me.”
• Former high school rivals Tyler Manoa and Atonio Mafi are now UCLA teammates hoping to fortify the defensive line.
• Now, for the latest chapter in ‘How the Cal QB Situation Turns.’
• And the Arizona version, starring Khalil Tate and the backups.
• Finally: TMG’s Chris Dufresne, one of the west coast’s foremost authorities on the sport: “The (Pac-12) has one viable playoff contender, No. 7 Washington, but has positioned it perfectly to be eliminated as soon as this Saturday.”


Dirty Play
(A section devoted to content on the basketball corruption scandal.)
• Brian Bowen Sr. returned to the witness stand Tuesday in a Lower Manhattan courthouse. His responses to questions about cash payments from an Oregon assistant coach could best be summarized in three words: “I don’t recall.” (Hmmmm.) Here’s the full report from the Oregonian’s Brad Schmidt, who’s on the scene in New York. Meanwhile, columnist John Canzano asks an important question: If the FBI has some revealing information on the Ducks’ recruiting practices, does the NCAA even care?


On the Hardwood
• UCLA freshman guard Tyger Campbell will miss the season because of a torn ACL. He’s the second member of Steve Alford’s vaunted recruiting class to be declared out for the year for health reasons. Forward Shareef O’Neal, if you hadn’t heard, is out indefinitely with a heart condition.


Choice Reads

• ESPN’s headline says everything: ‘UCLA Bruins on road to irrelevance in Chip Kelly’s first season.’ OK, maybe not everything. The story itself, by Kyle Bonagura, positions the lost season within the framework of the Southern California sporting scene.
• Good insight into how Washington coach Chris Petersen treats big games. Basically, writes Matt Calkins of the Seattle Times, Petersen says one thing and does another: “It’s just funny how certain players vanish when it comes to availability before showdowns with Oregon or Washington State. Just another game? Please. Coach Pete’s not fooling anyone.”

When you live within driving — or BARTing — distance of San Francisco, it’s easy to forget Northern California has another portside city, one that’s less busy, less expensive and often easier to reach. Stockton is an up-and-comer with plenty to boast about, from big city attractions (think food trucks and shopping) to small town charms (homemade ice cream, anyone?).

Slip away from the Bay Area’s hustle and bustle to spend a day in Stockton, just a hop, skip and a jump away from home. Here’s the perfect itinerary for that jaunt.

10 a.m. Frittatas and sandos

It doesn’t take long to get to this city, especially when you’re zooming against traffic. Stop at Cast Iron Trading Co. at 114 N. San Joaquin St. to fuel your day. Once known as Cast Iron Cheese, Eric Lee and Tommy Mogan’s eatery became popular with locals as a pop-up shop and street food vendor. Now they serve specialty coffees and housemade breakfast items from a brick-and-mortar downtown. Dine in or get it to go.

Cast Iron Trading serves everything from breakfast sandos to Lockeford’s spicy sausage sliders. Jackie Burrell/Bay Area News Group
Or take a detour to Midtown Creperie at 2319 Pacific Ave. This New Orleans-inspired gem serves crepes both savory and sweet — plus beignets!

11 a.m. Makers and shops

Part maker’s market, part food festival, part concert in the park — there’s no other street fair quite like the 3-year-old Stockmarket. This every-other-month showing of artists, makers and entrepreneurs hocking their wares at Martin Luther King Plaza has continued to grow. It’s a one-stop shop to experience the sights, sounds, tastes and goods of Stockton.

The next Stockmarkets will be Aug. 11 and Oct. 13, so if you’re there another day, you’ll need to make other plans. Luckily, Stockton has some robust shopping centers, including Lincoln Center, where the clothes are posh and the housewares are on-trend.

Details: www.stockmarketca.com; lincolncentershops.com.

12 p.m. Bites and brews

Stockton is home to a fleet of street-food trucks that frequent downtown and the surrounding area. From gyros at Go Falafel Extra Virgin Greek Food to fine Cuban cuisine at Elsa’s Paladar, there’s a little bit of everything on wheels. Green Papaya, which was featured on Food Network’s “Diners, Drive Ins & Dives,” brings a mix of Lao and Thai food.

Most of the trucks post locations on Facebook and tracking down a favorite is half the fun. Both Go Falafel (www.facebook.com/GoFalafel4u) and Elsa’s (http://bit.ly/2M0FrRs) are often parked on Pacific Avenue near Benjamin Holt Drive. Find Green Papaya’s truck and fast-casual restaurant at www.facebook.com/greenpapayaft.

Then head for Channel Brewing Company at 110 N. San Joaquin St., next to Cast Iron Trading. Four friends opened this brewpub last year, on a mission to brew good beer and encourage outdoor living. The Channel squad has seven brews on tap, ready to taste and featuring everything from a sour IPA to a blonde ale. Tip back a few, or grab a six-pack to go. The staff is required to be walking encyclopedias on the best places to hike, paddleboard and play disc golf nearby — so if you’re up for an adventure, don’t be afraid to ask.

Still hungry? Every dessert is Instagram-worthy at Stockton’s House of Ice Cream at 947 N. El Dorado St., where the over-the-top treats are made fresh daily with locally sourced ingredients. Order up a crazy milkshake — horchata, perhaps, butter brittle or PB&J — served in a mason jar and topped with a doughnut.

Details: channelbrewing.co.; www.houseoficecream.net

3 p.m. Splashes and trails

How can you visit a portside city and not get in the water? The 180-acre Oak Grove Regional Park on Eight Mile Road is one of the best parks in the Central Valley. Hook a catfish in the 10-acre lake or rent a paddleboat ($6) and splash about. There’s disc golf, hiking trails, a nature center and picnic areas, too. Plus it’s pet friendly, although Fido ($1) will need a leash.

Details: 4520 W. Eight Mille Road; www.sjparks.com. Parking is $5-$10 (no credit cards).



6 p.m. Dinner and a show

Stockton’s food scene has taken off. It’s hard to go wrong with delectable eats from celebrity chef Michael Midgley and waterfront Mexican cuisine at Nena’s Mexican restaurant. If you’re looking for the perfect mix of casual and elegant, step into De Vega Brothers, a white-tablecloth Italian restaurant known for its traditional eats.

You’ll find an event schedule at StocktonLive.com that ranges from epic Pink Floyd tribute band Brit Floyd to ukulele legend Jake Shimabukuro and more.

11 p.m. Zzzzz’s

	Saudi Arabia vows retaliation even as its stock market plunges

					The Saudi stock market sharply fell Sunday after President Donald Trump threatened "severe punishment" over the disappearance of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi.
				

By JON GAMBRELL
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia on Sunday threatened to retaliate for any sanctions imposed against it after President Donald Trump said the oil-rich kingdom deserves “severe punishment” if it is responsible for the disappearance and suspected murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi.
The warning from the world’s top oil exporter came after a turbulent day on the Saudi stock exchange, which plunged as much as 7 percent at one point.


The statement was issued as international concern grew over the writer who vanished on a visit to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul over a week ago. American lawmakers threatened tough punitive action against the Saudis, and Germany, France and Britain jointly called for a “credible investigation” into Khashoggi’s disappearance.
Turkish officials have said they fear a Saudi hit team killed and dismembered Khashoggi, who wrote critically of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The kingdom has called such allegations “baseless” but has not offered any evidence Khashoggi ever left the consulate.

Already, international business leaders are pulling out of the kingdom’s upcoming investment forum, a high-profile event known as “Davos in the Desert,” and the sell-off on Riyadh’s Tadawul stock exchange showed that investors are uneasy.
The exchange dropped by over 500 points, then clawed back some of the losses, ending the day down 264 points, or more than 4 percent. Of 188 stocks traded on the exchange, 179 ended the day with a loss.
“Something this big would definitely spook investors, and Saudi just opened up for foreign direct investment, so that was big,” said Issam Kassabieh, a financial analyst at Dubai-based firm Menacorp Finance. “Investors do not feel solid in Saudi yet, so it’s easy for them to take back their funds.”
In an interview scheduled to air Sunday, Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” that Saudi Arabia would face strong consequences if involved in Khashoggi’s disappearance.
“There’s something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that was the case, so we’re going to have to see,” Trump said. “We’re going to get to the bottom of it, and there will be severe punishment.”
But the president has also said “we would be punishing ourselves” by canceling arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The sales are a “tremendous order for our companies,” and if the Saudis don’t buy their weaponry from the U.S., they will get it from others, he said.
In a statement published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, the kingdom warned that if it “receives any action, it will respond with greater action, and that the kingdom’s economy has an influential and vital role in the global economy.”
“The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures or repeating false accusations,” the statement said.
The statement did not elaborate. However, a column published in English a short time later by the general manager of the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya satellite news network suggested Saudi Arabia could use its oil production as a weapon. Benchmark Brent crude is trading at around $80 a barrel, and Trump has criticized OPEC and Saudi Arabia over rising prices.

“If the price of oil reaching $80 angered President Trump, no one should rule out the price jumping to $100, or $200, or even double that figure,” Turki Aldakhil wrote.
It’s unclear, however, whether Saudi Arabia would be willing to unilaterally cut production.
Aldakhil added that Saudi arms purchases from the U.S. and other trade could be at risk as well. “The truth is that if Washington imposes sanctions on Riyadh, it will stab its own economy to death, even though it thinks that it is stabbing only Riyadh!” he wrote.

Prince Mohammed has aggressively pitched the kingdom as a destination for foreign investment. But Khashoggi’s disappearance has led several business leaders and media outlets to back out of the upcoming investment conference in Riyadh called the Future Investment Initiative. That includes the CEO of Uber, a company in which Saudi Arabia has invested billions of dollars, as well as billionaire Richard Branson.Khashoggi has written extensively for the Post about Saudi Arabia, criticizing its war in Yemen, its recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of women’s rights activists after the lifting of a ban on women driving. Those policies are all seen as initiatives of the crown prince.
Associated Press writer Malak Harb contributed to this report.

The CEO and owners of Backpage.com are accused of heinous crimes, but California Attorney General Kamala Harris’ indictment of the three men could lead to a major upheaval for some Silicon Valley tech companies, experts said Friday.

Backpage is an online marketplace that has been fighting authorities for years because it carries ads featuring escorts who pose provocatively and, authorities say, offer sex for sale. Now, Harris is arguing that selling those ads makes Backpage executives guilty of illegal acts, charging CEO Carl Ferrer, 55, and controlling shareholders Michael Lacey, 68, and James Larkin, 67, with pimping children under 16 and other felony offenses. Ferrer was arrested Thursday.

On Friday, Backpage issued a statement calling Harris’ prosecution “flatly illegal” and Ferrer’s Texas arrest on a California warrant an “election year stunt.” Through company lawyer Liz McDougall, the company said the indictment and search warrant make clear that prostitution ads violate its policies against posting illegal content and that it had “blocked the posting of ads using terms that violated those policies.”

The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children has worked on more than 400 cases since 2012 involving “children sold for commercial sex on Backpage,” California Department of Justice Special Agent Brian Fichtner said in a written statement.

Few in the tech industry were defending Backpage on Friday, but the principle at stake is a different matter, said David Greene, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. A number of companies depend on the same argument Backpage makes — that they cannot be held liable for third-party content on their websites. Harris’ indictment rejects that notion, suggesting firms are responsible for that content even if they are not, Greene said, “actively working in concert with criminals.”

“It seems from the indictment that criminal liability is based on running platforms,” Greene said. “That’s holding someone responsible for others’ content.”

Should the prosecution force Backpage to shut down, issues could arise for companies such as Twitter or Facebook, which unveiled its new Marketplace feature this week, experts said. Tech firms might see sex ads migrate onto their sites, said University of Santa Clara School of Law professor Eric Goldman.

“Are Facebook executives going to be charged with pimping because there are prostitutes running their advertisements on Facebook?” Goldman asked.

Social media firms in general could suffer fallout from the Backpage case, EFF’s Greene said. “If immunity from what their users do on their sites is weakened, then that could force them to change how they make their sites available.”

					
				

At present, firms that host user content online are protected from state criminal liability over that content by a section of the federal Communications Decency Act.

“If a prosecutor brings a state criminal prosecution predicated on liability for third-party content, it’s pre-empted by Section 230” of the act, said Goldman. But Goldman said it’s possible the Backpage case will end up going in a different direction: California prosecutors “may try to argue that the facts are not based on third-party content, but based on stuff that the defendants actually did.”

In going after Backpage, Harris — in the midst of a U.S. Senate campaign — might have been emboldened by last year’s courtroom victory over the operator of a revenge-porn website. Kevin Bollaert was sentenced to 18 years in prison — despite a Section 230 defense, Goldman said.

It was Bollaert’s design and operation of the site, rather than just the hosting of third-party content, that helped Harris get a conviction, Goldman said. “It’s possible they think they can hold (the Backpage defendants) accountable for the design and operation of Backpage, which has been in (prosecutors’) opinion optimized to facilitate online prostitution ads,” Goldman said.

Backpage said Harris’ actions violated Section 230, and pointed out that a number of federal courts have ruled that the company’s ads are protected by the First Amendment.

“Backpage.com will take all steps necessary to end this frivolous prosecution and will pursue its full remedies under federal law against the state actors who chose to ignore the law, as it has done successfully in other cases,” the company said.

Beyond the scope of the Backpage case, the prosecution raises the specter of firms that run online marketplaces — such as Facebook, Craigslist and eBay — being prosecuted for other illegal activity. “You could go to another crime and say, ‘You are selling stolen property by publishing information,'” Goldman said.

Authorities have successfully prosecuted cases against companies acting as intermediaries when the firms themselves were “involved in the deception or crime,” said UC Berkeley School of Information professor Chris Hoofnagle.

Investigators can look deeply into the company’s operations and communications to determine how much those controlling it knew about the content appearing on the site, Hoofnagle said.

“They inspect business records, communications with consumers, messaging to colleagues, and so on,” Hoofnagle said. “It’s not hard to pick apart what the company knows about users and their activities.”

However, authorities have been trying to shut down Backpage for a decade, and the tactic of using pimping charges against the three men could suggest desperation in the aftermath of the previous failures, Goldman said.

“If the theory of pimping works today,” he said, “it would’ve worked 10 years ago.”

John Paul Marcelo looked up at a sniper rifle trained on his canvas.

It was around 1999, in Chicago’s Near North Side, and Marcelo was standing in front of a brick apartment building, one of the many in Cabrini-Green, a public housing project made infamous as a poster child for government neglect, poverty and rampant gang violence.

A group of more than a dozen men surrounded him, sporting firearms, watching. But rather than staring stone-faced, they were smiling — perplexed, interested.

“Hey, my cousin is watching you painting. He thinks it’s awesome,” one of the men said to Marcelo as his gaze traveled up the stairwell to the rooftop where he spotted the sniper. “I didn’t feel endangered; I was more focused on the painting.”

It was amid this backdrop that Marcelo — who now lives in San Francisco and has a studio in Oakland — got his start as a plein air, or outdoors, painter. In part, his choice of subject matter was a product of his surroundings: He was born and raised in the Chicago area, he said, and painted what was available to him.

But, even early on, his eye naturally gravitated toward documenting history unfolding, however painful. And though the walls of his Oakland gallery sport plenty of serene seaside bluffs or bridges peaking out from beneath a blanket of fog, they also include protests erupting into bloody brawls, people living in tents under freeways or the skeletal remains of a car that caught on fire.

“This is our period in time,” he said. “This is what is happening.”

It’s with this objective approach that Marcelo relates more to photographers, and especially photojournalists, than he does to other impressionist painters. But that doesn’t mean he would describe himself as a journalist, he said. He is an observer, a documentarian, capturing life as it happens.

					
				

The reality of this approach means he may have only 20 or 30 minutes to capture a scene. Sometimes, he happens upon them, he said, like when he was in downtown Oakland on Saturday night and heard gunshots ring out. Carrying a backpack filled with paint and brushes, an easel he attaches to his bicycle and several “emergency canvasses” of varying sizes, Marcelo headed to the scene, painting a cop car and ribbon of crime scene tape, he said.

In other cases, when the San Bruno pipeline exploded, for example, or when the Tubbs Fire carved a valley of ash into Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park, he may return over several days or weeks to paint the wreckage.

For Marcelo, it’s more about the process than the product. He’s less concerned about a perfect painting as he is with recording a fleeting moment before it fades, of being able to interact with people whose lives intersect the scenes he paints, of watching the light as it changes colors or smelling the air around him as he works.

But his take-it-as-it-comes mentality doesn’t mean Marcelo is agnostic to the politics that turned Cabrini-Green into a magnet for violent crime or that resulted in more and more people piling under Oakland’s overpasses. He is very much aware of the larger context within which he makes art.

He oscillates between urban and rural surroundings in part, he said, out of fear the unbridled natural world may one day succumb to human consumption and disappear, or be forever altered. He approaches California’s rugged coastline, Alaska’s glaciers and sun-soaked mountains, a grove of cypress trees, and more, as vistas that should be preserved for future generations, he said, much in the same way Ansel Adams painstakingly photographed the American West.

The landscapes he sells to make a living, he said. But he’s not yet sure what to do with the hundreds of documentary paintings he’s accumulated over the years. He rarely sells them, only occasionally permitting someone who approaches him with an idea to use them to further some social good.

For the most part, he said, they’re stacked in boxes: a treasure trove of archival footage waiting to be rediscovered and put to use.

SAN FRANCISCO–The window is shutting quickly for the 2018 Giants, and if the franchise’s top decision-makers feel the current roster can’t prop it open, changes could be on the way. 

Manager Bruce Bochy and members of the Giants’ front office met for nearly an hour before Friday’s game against the Pirates to discuss the direction of a club that’s two games under .500 with just 46 left to play. 

 
“We just talked about some things which we do three-to-four times a year,” Bochy said. “We talked about the club and ways we can get better.”

The Giants opened the day 7.0 games back in both the division and wildcard races and have little margin for error if they hope to keep their dwindling playoff hopes alive into September. 

After losing five of their last six, it’s possible the front office has begun to realize the uphill battle may be too steep to climb for a team that’s hovered around .500 for most of the season. If the Giants feel there’s too much ground to overcome over the final two months of the year, the club could put a handful of their players on waivers to clear roster spots and opportunities for prospects and younger talent. 

Right fielder Andrew McCutchen has long been discussed as a trade candidate, and it’s likely the team’s top RBI producer would garner interest from contending clubs if the Giants placed him on waivers. Relief pitcher Sam Dyson is another player the Giants may place on waivers, as moving the right-hander could provide the club with some financial relief. 

If the Giants do elect to begin evaluating their prospects, Triple-A outfielder Chris Shaw, starting pitcher Shaun Anderson and catcher Aramis Garcia could all find themselves on the big league roster before the end of the season. A trade of McCutchen would free up a 40-man roster spot for Shaw, a 2015 first round draft choice who will need to be protected from the Rule-5 draft this offseason anyway. 

The Giants can also take another look at Mac Williamson, who hit three home runs in a span of five games in April before suffering a concussion that altered the course of a once-promising season. 

					
				

Though it’s unclear what Bochy and members of the Giants’ front office determined in their Friday meeting, they may have no choice but to implement changes to the regular lineup if the team’s skid continues against Pittsburgh this weekend and against the first-place Dodgers next week.

Kelly added to roster, Cueto placed on 60-day disabled list 

The Giants’ quest to build out the back end of their pitching staff led to journeyman starter Casey Kelly, who was promoted from Triple-A Sacramento Friday after reliever Derek Law was optioned. 

Kelly was a first round draft choice of the Red Sox in 2008 and has spent parts of the last 10 seasons in the minor leagues. The right-hander has started 23 games for the Sacramento River Cats this season, but Bochy said the Giants will look at him as a “swing guy” who could start or relieve. 

The son of former major league catcher Pat Kelly, Casey has appeared in 19 big league games and made nine starts. Kelly debuted in 2012 with the Padres and pitched in three games for San Diego in 2015. After appearing in 10 games with the Braves in 2016, Kelly joined the Cubs organization but never logged an inning in the majors with Chicago. 

Kelly signed with the Giants as a minor league free agent in the middle of 2017 and has posted a 4.78 ERA this season. Bochy hinted the Giants were considering Kelly for a promotion last week as he’s allowed two earned runs or fewer in three of his last four starts. 

“The biggest thing is just being consistent at this point,” Kelly said. “I feel like the last five or six outings have been consistent and I’ve been on a good roll here at the end of the season.” 

To clear a 40-man roster spot for Kelly, the Giants transferred right-hander Johnny Cueto to the 60-day disabled list. Cueto had Tommy John surgery last week and is expected to miss most if not all of the 2019 season.

	Charges dismissed against San Jose teen accused with brother in parents’ slaying

		
	Bruce Newman
	  
	PUBLISHED: June 24, 2016 at 9:22 am | UPDATED: August 11, 2016 at 11:08 pm

	  
		Categories:
		Crime & Courts, News	



	SAN JOSE — He had been accused in one of San Jose’s most shocking crimes — the double murder of his own mother and father — but as Omar Golamrabbi, 17, shuffled into the courtroom Friday, shackled in leg irons and handcuffs, the burden of suspicion was about to be lifted from his slight, stooped shoulders.
Golamrabbi, looking tired and slightly bewildered, sat waiting for someone to speak. Deputy district attorney Matt Braker rose to say that his office had analyzed material taken from the grisly crime scene and conducted further interviews since the murders April 24. Now he no longer believed there was enough evidence to proceed against the boy, who was being held in a juvenile detention center when his senior class at Evergreen Valley High School graduated May 24.
Judge Sharon A. Chatman brought down her gavel with a crack, and in a loud, clear voice declared, “All charges are dismissed.” In three minutes, it was over. And yet it was far from over for Golamrabbi.


He had been charged along with his older brother, 22-year-old Hasib Bin Golamrabbi, who is still being held in connection with the murder of their parents in the family’s hillside Evergreen home. When police discovered the bodies of Golam Rabbi, 59, and Shamima Rabbi, 57, they found bizarre messages scrawled on the wall. “Sorry my first kill was clumsy,” one said. 
Omar was believed to be in the home when the murders occurred and had seemed to implicate himself by going to an anime convention with his brother in Oakland after the slayings, both of them seemingly acting as if nothing had happened.
“The defendant did engage in behavior that was highly suspicious,” Braker said outside the courtroom. “But we have no hard evidence.”
Jessica Delgado, the deputy alternate public defender who was Omar Golamrabbi’s co-counsel, said he was a “witness” to what happened, and while she declined to elaborate upon what he saw, Delgado argued that the circumstances of his parents’ deaths could explain how he was able to continue attending school for three days before his arrest.
“Sometimes when traumatic things happen to someone,” she said following the dismissal, “they may behave in ways that don’t seem expected or normal. I think in this case, Omar’s affect, and the way that he was processing his grief and his trauma, may have been confusing to law enforcement.”
Omar Golamrabbi’s attorneys issued a statement thanking the District Attorney’s Office for continuing to examine the evidence “with an open mind,” despite intense media attention created by the circumstances surrounding the crime. “We’re really grateful to the DA’s office for continuing to evaluate this case with an open mind,” said Sajid A. Khan, of the public defender’s office. “It required a certain amount of courage for them to do so.”
Omar Golamrabbi was released from detention within hours of the hearing Friday, but if his guilt was no longer in question, there was much that still was. He was getting out, but to what? To where? To whom? With his parents dead, and his older brother in jail, charged with two counts of murder, Omar became a ward of the county, dependent upon a social worker to find an appropriate home for him.
“He is, of course, happy not to be in custody,” said Delgado. “But this is a very difficult situation for him.”

	Fatal e-scooter accident emerges just as California legalizes riding without a helmet

		
	The Washington Post

					In this July 24 photo, riders make their way across a street on Bird electric scooters in the Venice Beach section of Los Angeles.
				

Peter Holley | The Washington Post 
A 24-year-old Dallas man who died after falling off a Lime electric scooter was killed by blunt force injuries to his head, county officials said Thursday, likely making him the first person to die while riding the electric mobility devices that have swept across the nation this year.
The death of Jacoby Stoneking has been ruled an accident, the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office told The Washington Post before releasing the information publicly. Police said Stoneking was riding a Lime scooter home from a restaurant where he works when the accident occurred. He was found unconscious and badly injured in the early morning hours of Sept. 1, several hundred yards from a scooter that was broken in half. He was not wearing a helmet, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk freely about the investigation.


The determination by Dallas officials emerged just after California Gov. Jerry Brown, D, signed a bill Wednesday that makes it legal for adults to ride electric scooters without a helmet. The new law also grants cities in California the authority to let scooters operate on streets with speeds limits up to 35 mph, a 10-mph increase.

The three largest e-scooter companies, Lime, Bird, and Skip, said they were unaware of any other fatal accidents involving their devices. When asked for comment about the passage of the California bill in light of the e-scooter death in Dallas, Ali Bay, deputy press secretary for Gov. Brown, simply responded in an email: “The Governor’s action speaks for itself.”
Lime has pledged to launch an investigation into Stoneking’s death. In a statement Thursday, it said: “Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family and loved ones of the victim. We are working tirelessly with local authorities in support of their ongoing investigation. We have and will continue to work with them in a transparent manner.”
Financial analysts say Lime may be worth more than $1 billion in market value after receiving $335 million in financing that included a major investment from Uber. In an interview with The Washington Post earlier this year, Uber’s chief executive Dara Khoshrowshahi spoke of the critical role e-scooters and bike-sharing could have in his company’s efforts to transform urban transportation.
Khoshrowshahi has also taken pains to rehabilitate Uber’s image as a grow-at-all-costs company. When an Uber self-driving car struck and killed an Arizona woman in March, Khoshrowshahi quickly froze the company’s autonomous driving program until it could be deemed safe.
When told about the Lime fatality, Uber said in a statement: “Customer safety is essential to Uber, whether for bikes, scooters or cars. As we continue working through our scooter product and Lime integration, we’re keeping safety top of mind.”
The three e-scooter companies have aggressively expanded nationally, and some analysts estimate as many as 65,000 scooters are now on streets across the country. The start-ups have also launched services overseas.
But almost as soon as the scooters arrived in towns and cities, severe injuries have followed.
Emergency room doctors in a dozen cities told The Post that they are seeing a spike in scooter accidents. In seven cities, those physicians are regularly seeing “severe” injuries – including head traumas – that were sustained from scooters malfunctioning or flipping over on uneven surfaces as well as riders being hit by cars or colliding with pedestrians.
“An electric scooter is pretty much a moped, just a little slower,” said Dr. Sam Torbati, co-chair and medical director of the Ruth and Harry Roman Emergency Department at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles. “People seem to feel safe since it looks like a recreational tool, but it comes with potential for serious injury.”
Torbati said it will take another year for the hospital to collect enough data to make a proper risk assessment for electric scooters, but he parroted a message repeated by every doctor The Post interviewed: Wear a helmet.
“It makes me real anxious when I see someone with ear buds and a cup of coffee riding without a helmet on the sidewalk,” he added. “The public is excited for this fun new form of transportation, but the injuries we’re seeing suggest they’re not aware of the risks involved. They could get seriously injured.”
Dr. Christopher Michael Ziebell, the medical director for Dell Seton Emergency Department in Austin Tex., said his staff has treated nine “severe traumas” stemming from electric scooters since the devices arrived in Austin in April.
For whatever reason, he said, scooter riders seem to feel “invincible” as they weave through traffic and sidewalks.
But their brains are especially vulnerable during accidents, and a severe head injury can result, Ziebell said.

“A severe head injury is not a simple concussion or a skull fracture,” he said. “It’s actually bleeding inside the skull cavity in or around the brain that results in damage to parts of the brain that may sometimes be permanent. It requires significant rehabilitation and prolonged hospitalization to treat.”Scooter companies have repeatedly maintained that safety is a top priority. They say their apps and labels on the scooters contain basic safety information, as well as training instructions. Bird requires users to upload a driver’s license and confirm they’re at least 18 years old.
Bird and Skip have programs that give helmets to riders who request them, and Lime notes that riders must go through an “in-app tutorial” on helmet safety to unlock one of the company’s scooters for the first time.

						The beverage industry is working in Sacramento to block new taxes on soda pop.		
	
By Daniel Borenstein | dborenstein@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: June 27, 2018 at 6:15 am | UPDATED: June 28, 2018 at 4:12 am


In a devious political move, the beverage industry is leveraging California’s new initiative rules to extract legislation banning more cities from taxing soda pop.

The scheme has left taxpayer groups that had lent support to an initiative campaign sitting on the sidelines, the League of California Cities reluctantly conceding defeat and health advocates who back soda taxes furious.

It’s not a done deal yet. Ongoing delicate negotiations must be completed by the Thursday deadline. But if, as seems likely, the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown capitulate, it will be a sweet deal for the beverage industry.

The industry has spent millions of dollars during the past decade campaigning against taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. Voters in four California cities – Oakland, Berkeley, Albany and San Francisco – have nevertheless passed such taxes. Other cities were expected to try this fall, including Richmond for the second time.

Rather than continue fighting cities individually, the soda industry is trying to block them in one fell swoop. That’s where the initiative gambit comes in.

The American Beverage Association has poured $7 million into a signature-gathering drive for an initiative that would severely tighten the rules for passage of a variety of local tax measures.

Specifically, it would expand the definition of taxes and make more taxes subject to two-thirds voter approval rather than a simple majority. As a result, local governments would have a much harder time raising new revenues.

As of Tuesday, the Secretary of State’s Office was still tabulating the signatures, but the measure was expected to have enough to qualify for the November ballot.

					
				

Seeing the havoc the measure could wreak on local governments, which are desperate for new money because of soaring pension costs, labor unions, cities, counties and the governor’s office engaged in negotiations with initiative backers that began Friday.

Under the proposed deal, the initiative would be withdrawn from the ballot in exchange for legislation setting a moratorium on new soda taxes until 2031. The legislation, SB 872, would leave in place soda taxes in the four cities that already have them.

The deal must be wrapped up by Thursday evening, when the Secretary of State’s Office finalizes the list of measures for the November ballot.

Using the threat of an initiative to extract favorable legislative is not new in California. But under rules that started with the 2016 election, backers of initiatives can withdraw their measures even after signatures are submitted to be counted.

What makes this deal especially unusual is the big gap between the initiative’s overarching tax law changes and the singularly focused soda tax moratorium in the legislative compromise.

On Monday evening, Carolyn Coleman, executive director of the League of California Cities, issued a statement effectively admitting her organization was cutting its losses.

“While many aspects of SB 872 are distasteful because it would preempt the ability for cities and other local agencies (to levy) any new tax, fee or assessment on groceries and soda for 12 years,” she said, “we recognize that the legislation must be compared with the potential passage of the more onerous initiative.”

Make no mistake, says Rob Lapsley, president of California Business Roundtable, if the initiative goes to the ballot it will pass. He says his polling clearly shows that.

Lapsley is the official sponsor of the initiative and, consequently, he holds the authority to pull it back before the deadline. He says he’s prepared to move forward with the campaign if the deal falls apart.

But he’s also willing to compromise. “When there are discussions and there is an opportunity to create certainty on products that matter to every Californian that has to buy groceries, and we’re able to limit taxes on those products, that is what we would consider a win.”

While the beverage association has thus far bankrolled most of the costs for the initiative, the coalition behind it included Lapsley’s business roundtable and taxpayer groups that thought they were fighting for a more broad-based outcome.

“We support the initiative, but we aren’t running the campaign,” said David Kline, vice president of communications and research at the California Taxpayers Association.

“Some of the coalition partners behind the effort were taken by surprise at the potential arrangement,” adds Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.

On the other side, leaders of the American Heart Association were similarly surprised. The ban on soda taxes “will only create a roadblock to a generation of healthy Californians,” they wrote in a letter to the editor printed Wednesday morning.

However meritorious their concerns are, that’s probably not what will carry the day in Sacramento. By Thursday night, we’ll know whether the soda industry got its way.

By Casey Tolan | ctolan@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: May 23, 2018 at 9:00 pm | UPDATED: May 24, 2018 at 8:25 am


With less than two weeks to go before the June 5 election, two new polls show that the primary for California governor has turned into a battle for second place.

Both polls confirm months-long trends showing Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom leading the pack, with Republican businessman John Cox and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in second and third.

A poll from the Public Policy Institute of California released Wednesday put Newsom at 25 percent, with Cox at 19 percent and Villaraigosa at 15 percent among likely voters.

Another poll from the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Times conducted over the last month found the contest for second place even closer, with Newsom at 21 percent, Cox at 11 percent and Villaraigosa at 10 percent.

Bringing up the rear were State Treasurer John Chiang and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin, and Assemblyman Travis Allen, a Republican. In the PPIC poll, Allen had 11 percent, Chiang had 9 percent and Eastin had 6 percent. In the USC poll, Chiang had 6 percent, Allen had 5 percent and Eastin had just 3 percent.

Meanwhile, both polls found Sen. Dianne Feinstein a clear favorite for re-election to the U.S. Senate, with former State Senate President Kevin de León, also a Democrat, in second and above a crowded field of little-known Republican candidates. Feinstein had 41 percent and de León had 17 percent in the PPIC poll, while Feinstein had 31 percent and de León had 7 percent in the USC poll. Neither poll found a Republican candidate above 3 percent.

Mark Baldassare, the PPIC poll’s director, said both races had stayed remarkably consistent since the end of last year.

In the governor’s contest, “the biggest movement has been for John Cox, who started out at 9 percent and today is at 19 percent,” as he’s found wider Republican support, Baldassare said.

The results also give context to the intense and sometimes puzzling politicking surrounding the primary, in which the top two candidates regardless of party will go on to the general election.

					
				

Newsom’s campaign has been actively working to boost Cox into the top two, airing TV ads contrasting the two candidates and raising Cox’s name recognition. The lieutenant governor would be heavily favored in a traditional Democratic-vs-Republican race against Cox. Newsom said at a debate this month that he would prefer to face a Republican and “either of these will do.”

“If one of the Republicans ends up in the top two, Gavin Newsom can take the next five months off and go to Hawaii,” said Garry South, a Democratic strategist who’s worked for both Newsom and Villaraigosa in the past.

Newsom also unveiled a barrage of new ads this week hitting Villaraigosa and Chiang, in a bid to keep their support down and barring any unforeseen glitches, wrap up the race in June instead of in November.

Meanwhile, an independent pro-charter school campaign backing Villaraigosa has recently targeted Cox, aiming to lower his numbers and get the former L.A. mayor into the top two. In mailers to Republican voters, the pro-Villaraigosa group attacked Cox as a “Democratic activist” with a “liberal record,” and highlighting the fact that Cox didn’t vote for President Trump in 2016.

Cox, however, got a major boost when Trump endorsed him in a tweet last week. He’s trumpeted that support on talk radio, hoping the president’s stamp of approval will help him consolidate support among GOP voters.

“Cox ought to be talking about Trump all the time,” said Bob Shrum, the director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “It will hurt him in the general, but it’s his best hope of getting into the top two.”

Even though both polls put Cox above Villaraigosa, the former mayor has a strong financial advantage, including his independent supporters. Campaigns supporting the former mayor have spent more than $12 million on expenditures backing him, while Newsom’s backers have spent $4 million.

The next two weeks might be a test of just how much a Trump endorsement tweet is worth — and whether the president’s backing will be more helpful to Cox than the millions of outside money is to Villaraigosa. Those are “the two political wildcards in this race,” Baldassare said.

Besides the state’s two marquee races, the PPIC poll found Californians were closely divided on the issue of single-payer health care, which has become a major point of contention in the governor’s race. Forty-one percent of likely voters said they supported a single-payer, government-run health care system, even if it meant raising taxes, while 12 percent said they’d back it if it didn’t raise taxes — a highly unlikely prospect — and another 41 percent opposed the idea altogether. The results were heavily split by party.

In addition, half of all Californians and three-fourths of Democrats polled believe that the Russian government tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election with intentional help from the Trump campaign. An additional 12 percent believe the Russians played a role without the assistance of team Trump, while 25 percent said they thought Vladimir Putin’s regime didn’t try to influence the vote.

Among all adult Californians polled, 44 percent approve of Gov. Jerry Brown’s job performance, while 38 percent disapprove. Only 30 percent think Trump is doing a good job, while 63 percent disapprove of him — although three-fourths of Republicans approve of Trump, which is good news for Cox.

The PPIC poll had a margin of error of plus and minus 4.1 percent for the 901 likely voters it surveyed. It was conducted with live telephone interviews on both landlines and cellphones in English and in Spanish, and gave respondents only a curated selection of the top candidates.

The USC poll, on the other hand, was online and presented respondents with a randomized list of all of the dozens of candidates who will appear on the ballot. It surveyed 517 likely voters had a margin of error of plus and minus 4 percent.

	Football: De La Salle demolishes Foothill on senior night

					De La Salle's Shamar Garrett, shown here in a file photo, ran for a pair of TDs, threw another and also found the end zone on a pick-6 during a 55-10 victory at home over Foothill on Friday, Oct. 12, 2018.
				

CONCORD — On senior night at De La Salle, it was a junior that stole the show.
Shamar Garrett ran for a pair of touchdowns in the first quarter, then got creative in the second quarter with a TD pass off a halfback option and two plays later delivered the knockout blow with a pick-6 during a 55-10 rout of Foothill.
“He’s a special athlete,” De La Salle coach Justin Alumbaugh said. “The sky is the limit with him.”


Everyone on the roster for the Spartans (8-0, 2-0 EBAL-Mountain) healthy enough to play took the field against the Falcons (2-6, 0-3).
That included quarterback Andrew Jones, a senior who got the nod to start the game and accounted for a pair of touchdowns in the first half — a 58-yard pass to sophomore Lu-Magia Hearns, who eluded a tackle at the line of scrimmage with a spin move, plus a 65-yard keeper.
“I just wanted to see our seniors make good memories,” Alumbaugh said. “I didn’t want them looking back wishing they would’ve done something different. And all of them had their families here. They almost always do, but tonight was special.”
“It was their night,” Garrett said. “It was very important for the seniors, of course, for the win. But just playing together and just having fun together tonight, it was all just a good feeling.”
Foothill tried its best to play the role of spoiler by recovering a surprise onside kick after losing the coin toss. But following a couple of first downs, the drive stalled and the Falcons missed on a 38-yard field goal attempt.
A 62-yard run by DLS senior Henry To’oto’o flipped field position and Garrett capped a four-play, 80-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown run.
Not ready to go away, the Falcons recovered a muffed punt near midfield after a three-and-out, then a 15-yard penalty and a 16-yard completion to Brandon Villanueva helped set up a 27-yard field goal by Josh Fields to get within 7-3 with 3:55 left in the first quarter.
“They do what we ask them to do, which is continue to fight and continue to battle,” Foothill coach Greg Haubner said. “It’s really what we kind of do at Foothill.”
With a chance to force a punt on the ensuing possession, the Falcons were unable to corral Hearns on a slip screen just shy of midfield to fall behind 14-3.
But nothing prepared the visitors for the sight of Fields limping off the field with 2:07 left in the first quarter after injuring his left knee.
“He’s the heart and soul of our run game, he’s a great kid,” Haubner said. “He plays so hard for us and to lose him in a game like this is just very frustrating, because there’s just certain things that you want to accomplish in a game against De La Salle, and getting out of the game without injuries is No. 1.”
For more Bay Area high school sports coverage follow Bay Area Preps on Flipboard.Aside from a couple of personal fouls, Foothill didn’t manage another first down the rest of the half as De La Salle put up 41 unanswered points on five drives that required a combined 10 snaps — 4, 2, 2, 1, 1 — plus the pick-6.
“I think we were a little amped up at the beginning,” Alumbaugh said. “Made a couple of special teams mistakes and a couple of penalties early on, but other than that we played well.”
Garrett was responsible for three consecutive touchdowns in a span of 3 minutes, 14 seconds. There was a 33-yard TD run in which he weaved through traffic, a 24-yard pass to senior Matthew Oertli and the 28-yard interception return to the house.
“To be honest, I don’t really have a favorite,” Garrett said of his scoring plays. “We all did our thing and no touchdown is ever my touchdown — it’s everyone’s touchdown.”
Alumbaugh, though, appeared to favor the halfback option to Oertli.
“That touchdown pass was to a senior that had worked really hard and his mom passed in the offseason, so that was a pretty special moment for our team,” the coach said. “It was neat.”
Sophomore QB Dorian Hale saw limited action, his highlight an 80-yard touchdown pass on a quick slant to junior tight end Clayton Seastrand.

The entire second half took place on a running clock, with the Spartans ahead 48-3 at intermission.
Both teams traded touchdowns in the fourth quarter: Foothill on a 6-yard pass from quarterback Bryce Lombardi to wideout Cole Busner, while DLS senior Jacob Huckleberry crossed the goal line from 3 yards out with 4:21 left.
“That’s a very good team, a state contender, likely state finalist and wish them the best of luck,” Haubner said.
“We’ve been practicing well, which is key,” Alumbaugh said. “And it’s been showing in the games, especially the last two weeks.”
“Our goal right now is just to keep making forward progress and not take a step back,” Garrett said.

SAN JOSE — A veteran San Jose Police Department officer who is Muslim contends he has been steadily harassed at work because of his race and religion and says an Islamophobic joke at a police briefing last fall was the tipping point.

Officer Nabil Haidar, who has been with SJPD since 1997, filed a claim Monday against the city of San Jose alleging “continuous harassment and discrimination based upon his race, national origin and religion,” according to a statement from his attorney Randall Strauss.

The Lebanese-American officer says he was subjected to discriminatory behavior that “increased in severity over the years” but he didn’t complain out of fear of retaliation.

He said he changed his mind after a November briefing when a police captain was recognizing veterans in the room and a police sergeant reportedly stated, “Captain, you forgot to mention Nabil. He is an ISIS veteran. He was with ISIS for two years,” alluding to the notorious Islamic State terrorist network.

Haidar also claims his wife was the recipient of similar remarks at least once.

“When somebody chips at your soul day in and day out, that’s torture,” Haidar said in an interview with NBC Bay Area.

When asked about the claim, SJPD Chief Eddie Garcia said he could not give comment directly, citing personnel protections. But he strongly objected to the idea that his department has systemic issues with discrimination, Islamophobia or otherwise.

“It’s an unfair characterization,” Garcia said. “I can’t speak to the lawsuit, but what I can speak to is that allegations such as this are handled seriously and I find them unacceptable.”

Police officials said they could not recall any previous city claim against the department alleging discrimination against Muslims, and said their frequent contact with Muslim organizations would have revealed such behavior if it was happening.

					
				

Adnan Rasheed, chairman of the South Bay Islamic Association Board of Trustees and a member of the police department’s Community Advisory Board, said he hasn’t witnessed any police discrimination.

“Honestly, no,” Rasheed said. “That’s my own opinion and I’ll take it to the bank anytime.”

Multiple officers who worked with Haidar, and talked to this news organization on condition of anonymity to avoid legal retaliation, asserted Haidar has long made self-deprecating jokes about himself and terrorism, and that he would joke about colleagues in similarly boorish fashion.

Haidar challenged that description.

“What did I say? Let them come forward and say what I said,” he told NBC Bay Area.

Claims like the one filed on behalf of Haidar typically precede civil litigation. Haidar states he began experiencing increasing harassment after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, including casual remarks about being a “suicide bomber.”

Haidar claims a report to Internal Affairs about the November briefing incident did not yield a swift response. He also alleges he was similarly harassed by colleagues while responding to a burglary call in January, the same month he requested a transfer from patrol to recruitment.

At the end of his claim, Haidar asserts the harassment that prompted him to transfer has cost him salary and overtime loss equivalent to $150,000 a year and will cost him $1.35 million over the next nine years, when he plans to retire. He is claiming that amount of economic loss for the harassment, as well as $5 million in non-economic damage for “severe emotional stress.”

The case is reminiscent of a complaint filed last month against the San Francisco Police Department by an Afghan Muslim officer who claimed similar discrimination that included taunting and being accused of being a terrorist. The officer, who has declined to be named, spoke out with the aim of improving bias training at SFPD, which the department has said it has already been implementing.

Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Bay Area chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said her organization is monitoring the San Francisco case but could not recall any specific Muslim discrimination cases involving San Jose police. Still, she voiced concern about the allegation.

“Police departments are already facing a lot of scrutiny over their interactions with, and violence against, minority communities. One often-proposed solution is to increase diversity in the police force to ensure cultural competence and minimize bias,” Billoo said. “If, however, these are the experiences of Muslim police officers, one is forced to wonder just how deep-rooted the biases, which endanger us when levied by police officers, really are.”

Garcia asserted that his department has been at the forefront of embracing progressive and inclusive practices, including establishing a religious grooming exemption for a Sikh officer who needed to grow a beard in advance of his wedding, and launching a focused recruiting push for officers from the LGBTQ community.

“We’re not just tolerant, but we’re accepting,” Garcia said. “With everything we do, from cultural diversity training, taking part in the Pride parade, taking part in Ramadan, all the meetings I’ve had with local imams. This (allegation) is not our department.”

PUBLISHED: August 20, 2018 at 1:58 pm | UPDATED: August 21, 2018 at 8:26 am


She’s spent the last few years encouraging people to tidy up and get rid of the clutter. Now Marie Kondo wants them to bring stuff back into their homes. The Japanese organizer behind best-selling “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up” is launching a line of products.

First up: a six-piece set of sturdy paper boxes designed to help corral items and keep them in the proper place. They’ll sell for $89 a set.

Kondo designed the Hikidashi collection to replace the shoeboxes she initially recommended for organizing closets and drawers the KonMari way: folding socks, undergarments and T-shirts so they stand upright.

“I’m probably the only person in the world who makes such an official occasion to introduce empty boxes,” Kondo said recently while introducing the products.

The idea, she said, is to “make the things that you store inside happy,” rather than merely hide belongings away.
The boxes, available in pastel watercolor designs, can be purchased at konmari.com.

Kondo, who is all about spending time examining every item in your house and determining whether it brings you joy or not, isn’t stopping at products. She’s also got a show with Netflix in the works, but few details about it have been announced.

And once you’ve got your house all tidied, Kondo wants to help you tackle the office. Workplace organizing will be the focus of her next book, which she’s writing now.

	Millennials (and Tom Hanks) buying vintage typewriters

		
	Angela Hill
	  
	PUBLISHED: July 20, 2015 at 6:36 am | UPDATED: August 12, 2016 at 2:12 am

	  
		Categories:

	There’s no going back. Period. The chosen word has been pressed into permanence, etched in eternity. So, go with it, or go get another piece of paper.
When using the venerable typewriter, there’s no safety net, no backspace/delete get-out-of-mistakes-free button. You have to commit to the word, therefore think before you write. (Twitter users take note.) It’s a visceral connection when fingers press out prose on a hefty manual machine, commanding its assemblage of springs and levers to perform a magical haiku — or merely fill out a multipage document that might otherwise jam your printer. You can hear the words happen: the rapid hail-on-a-tin-roof rhythm when thoughts flow fast, or the slow plop of a drippy sink if you’re stuck in the mental mud.
Surely, most users of today’s tech-forward microprocessors will never go back to their predecessors. But for some — from Luddites to a surprising number of people under 35 — all computers and no typewriters makes writing a dull job, and they prefer the feel, the look, the nostalgia of the classic machines.


“Pressing the keys down takes so much more effort, but that effort says something about the effort of the creative process, the weight of what you’re writing,” says Kali Pollard, 24, an English major at UC Berkeley who had wanted a typewriter since childhood and finally received an old Olympia last Christmas. “I just love using it,” she says. “I’ll type a lot of poems and cut them out and make little poetry zines. There’s also kind of a free association that happens when you’re typing. It’s different than doing it on a keyboard, or even writing by hand.
“There’s no backspace, so what you do is what you get. Either you accept your typos, or scrap it and start over.”
For the past few years, typewriters have made a triumphant return, driving prices of classic models up into the hundreds of dollars.
“It’s a novelty to people who’ve grown up with computer keyboards,” says John Sansone, owner of Los Altos Business Machines, one of the Bay Area’s remaining shops that repairs and sells classic typewriters, along with newfangled printers and fax machines. His dad opened the place in the 1960s. It has the pleasant odor of ink and solvents and oils.
“Probably 80 percent I sell are to people under 35, and they have the money,” Sansone says, pointing to his window display of a shiny, wine-colored 1938 Corona Sterling, selling for $525, and a rare 1896 Bar-Lock with an ornate upright faceplate, priced at $800.
“People like the sound of the real bell instead of a computer sound,” he says. “They like pushing the carriage return, rolling in the paper. Especially teenage girls — they’re real big into it. They like the old ones with the glass keys. They write short stories or poetry.”
To be sure, all manner of creative uses have emerged, says Carmen Permillion, who has worked at California Typewriter on San Pablo Avenue in Berkeley for 30 years. “Artists love them, street performers use them, people use them at weddings for guests to type little comments,” she says. “We even have an occasional ‘type-in’ here at the store where people bring their own typewriters and just sit here and jam and talk about typewriters.”
At Berkeley Typewriter on University Avenue, owner Joe Banuelos repairs machines and sells vintage models ranging from $250 to $600. He thinks it’s funny when he has to teach younger people how to use them. “A lot of people come from the Silicon Valley, and they’ve never seen one, don’t know how to use it, ask how to delete and do this and that.”
Possibly the most famous collector of typewriters in modern times is actor Tom Hanks. In 2013 he wrote — probably typed — a love letter to his beloved writing instruments in a New York Times op-ed. “I use a manual typewriter — and the United States Postal Service — almost every day,” he wrote. “My snail-mail letters and thank-you notes, office memos and to-do lists, and rough — and I mean very rough — drafts of story pages are messy things, but the creating of them satisfies me like few other daily tasks.”
A couple of months ago, Hanks stopped in at the Los Altos shop with his son, Truman, a Stanford student. “They came in to get his son’s typewriter fixed, but he ended up buying a couple for himself, two Smith Coronas, one from the ’40s and one from the ’60s,” Sansone says.
At Vintiq, a hip vintage-goods store in Alameda, Raf Janssens displays a couple of antique typewriters in the showroom but sells many more to online collectors searching for certain models. He taught himself to repair the machines, not only for the currently booming business, but because he loves them.
“I compare it to vinyl records or 35 mm cameras,” he says. “You see this movement — the more progress we make in electronics and digital devices, the more desire there is to go back to something that keeps it physical.”
Janssens thinks, however, we may have hit the peak of the typewriter craze. “Now the big thing is Polaroids.”

SAN JOSE — The death of a construction company employee at downtown San Jose’s Silvery Towers site Thursday has triggered a state worker-safety probe into the development, which was already marred by allegations of underpayment of workers and project delays.

The investigation by Cal OSHA began after the discovery that a person had fallen at the Silvery Towers site, where two residential towers are being built at 188 W. St. James Street near North San Pedro Street.

The deceased individual, whose identity wasn’t immediately released, was on the payroll of Swinerton, a consultant on the construction project, which is being developed by China-based Full Power Properties, whose local offices are in Foster City.

“At approximately 6:00 am (Thursday) morning a fall occurred at a new residential tower construction project currently underway in San Jose’s downtown district,” according to Swinerton. “The incident resulted in the death of a Swinerton employee who had previously been a part of the team assisting the owner with consulting services.”

Swinerton notified the state’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or Cal OSHA, about the incident.

“Cal OSHA was notified at 10 a.m. of the fatality at Silvery Towers,” said Luke Brown, a spokesman for the state agency. “Cal OSHA is now investigating the incident.”

The state agency typically requires four to six months to complete such investigations.

Medical crews attempted to revive the victim, but were not successful, according to Swinerton.

“Safety is our number one priority; when something like this happens, we want to know why,” Swinerton stated.

					
				

Full Power and Swinerton are working with the project’s contractor, Foster City-based FPC Builders, and state investigators to help determine a cause.

“Initial findings indicate this death was not related to construction activities,” Swinerton said. “We are actively working with Cal OSHA and local authorities investigating the incident and cooperating fully to meet their requests for information.”

The Santa Clara County Coroner’s Office confirmed it was reviewing the situation, but said no information was being released as of late Thursday regarding the death.

The Silvery Towers construction site was closed Thursday and was scheduled to reopen on Monday, Aug. 20.

The development had previously landed in controversy over investigations related to wages and working conditions for construction workers on the site.

Questionable wage and labor practices at Silvery Towers first surfaced in 2017 when more than a dozen immigrant workers, who authorities said were being held in captivity in a Hayward warehouse, were freed by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Federal prosecutors and Hayward police claimed that Job Torres Hernandez forced his workers at Silvery Towers and other construction projects around the Bay Area to work without pay. Hernandez was indicted on charges of harboring illegal immigrants for commercial advantage or private financial gain.

On July 18, the U.S. Labor Department announced that after its investigation into the pay violations, 22 workers were paid $250,000 by Foster City-based Full Power Properties, the Chinese developer of the 650-unit Silvery Towers project. The department said that when not on the job, those workers had “lived in captivity in squalid conditions in a warehouse” controlled by Job Torres, an unlicensed subcontractor doing business as Nobilis Construction.

Sweeping reform draws ire from bill’s early architects, who contend one troubled system has been replaced by another

						File photo: California will become the first state to eliminate bail for suspects awaiting trial under a bill signed Tuesday by Gov. Jerry Brown.		
	
By Mercury News staff and wire reports | 
PUBLISHED: August 28, 2018 at 1:13 pm | UPDATED: August 29, 2018 at 4:44 am


SACRAMENTO — Gov. Jerry Brown on Tuesday signed sweeping legislation to eliminate cash bail in California. The change, which will take effect in October 2019, goes further than any other state in the country to remove money from pretrial detention.

“Today, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly,” Brown said in a statement.

Under Senate Bill 10, California will replace bail with “risk assessments” of individuals and nonmonetary conditions of release. Counties will establish local agencies to evaluate any individual arrested on felony charges for their likelihood of returning for court hearings and their chances of re-arrest.

Bill supporters including co-authors Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda, and state Sen. Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, all called the signing a transformative moment toward a more fair criminal-justice system in California.

“Abolishing money bail and replacing it with a risk-based system will enhance justice and safety,” Bonta said in a statement. “For too long, our system has allowed the wealthy to purchase their freedom regardless of their risk, while the poor who pose no danger languish in jail. No more. Freedom and liberty should never be pay to play.”

“This is a transformative day for our justice system,” Cantil-Sakauye said in a statement. “Our old system of money bail was outdated, unsafe, and unfair.”

But SB 10 has also strangely aligned bail bonds firms, and the activists who want to eliminate their industry, in opposition.

For early architects of the bill, like the San Jose-based civil-rights group Silicon Valley De-Bug, the version signed by Brown bears no resemblance to what they envisioned as a way to reduce the numbers of the people jailed before their trials simply because they can’t afford bail, a population that disproportionately skews toward people of color.

					
				

“This isn’t a gutted version of our bill, it’s a wholesale different bill,” De-Bug Director Raj Jayadev said. “SB 10 was going to take out the obstacles from people’s liberty, like money bail and mandatory exclusions. This just replaces the exploitative money bail system with a preventative system that will lead to an increase, not decrease, in pretrial detention.”

According to SB 10, a person whose risk to public safety and risk of failure to appear is determined to be “low” would be released with the least restrictive nonmonetary conditions possible. “Medium-risk” individuals could be released or held depending on local standards. “High-risk” individuals would remain in custody until their arraignment, as would anyone who has committed certain sex crimes or violent felonies, is arrested for driving under the influence for the third time in less than 10 years, is already under supervision by the courts or has violated any conditions of pretrial release in the previous five years.

Advocates of abolishing bail contend that too many defendants remain stuck in custody because they cannot afford to bail out, effectively creating unequal justice based on wealth. California is at the forefront of a national campaign to end money bail that has also recently seen states like New Jersey and New Mexico adopt polices to circumvent the for-profit bail industry, though none had yet eliminated bail completely.

David Quintana, a lobbyist for the California Bail Agents Association, said the industry is already mobilizing to block the new law from taking effect, though he declined to discuss the specifics.

“You don’t eliminate an industry and expect those people to go down quietly,” he said. “Every single weapon in our arsenal will be fired.”

SB 10 was approved by the Legislature last week, after a nearly two-year push, with largely Democratic support. But it faced heavy opposition from the bail industry and some former supporters of the bill, who said significant amendments to the final version would unjustly expand the number of suspects jailed while awaiting trial.

The American Civil Liberties Union of California, an original co-sponsor of the measure along with De-Bug, and other organizations pointed to provisions giving judges greater discretion during the arraignment hearing to decide whether to release an individual and on what conditions. SB 10 also introduces a process for the prosecution to file for “preventive detention,” blocking the defendant’s release pending a trial, if they believe there are no conditions that would ensure public safety or their appearance in court.

Jayadev called it a troubling catch-all clause that effectively negates all of the benchmarks meant to make the system fair.

“That allows anyone to be detained pretrial. It’s such a malleable descriptor,” he said. “What is so ironic about it is that these are all, by law, legally innocent people. Legally innocent people who can and will be incarcerated with no avenue to freedom.”

Staff writer Robert Salonga and Sacramento Bee reporter Alexei Koseff contributed to this report.

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

SAN JOSE — Police on Wednesday night released the identity of the suspect wanted in the shooting of a San Jose couple on Monday and believe he may be headed to Southern California or Mexico.

Pedro Castellon Medina, 31, is being sought in the killings of Marybel Jimenez, 27, and Pedro Jimenez, 28, whom authorities officially identified on Wednesday.

Medina, a San Jose resident, may already be in Los Angeles, San Fernando or San Diego, said police, who also think he may be attempting to flee to Mexico and using aliases to avoid detection.

On Wednesday, Marybel Jimenez’s family said that Medina had previously dated her. The Jimenezes had broken up and recently reunited.

“She just met this guy, but then they decided to go back together, and I think that’s when things happened,” said Olga Espinoza, Jimenez’s sister. Espinoza met the suspect a couple of times, but they did not have much conversation, she said. 

“He looked kind of like he was not all there, but my sister never really said anything about it,” Espinoza said. “I wish I could have done more, but unfortunately sometimes things happen like that. I just hope he’s caught and pays for what he’s done.”

Authorities found the couple just before dawn at their apartment in the 300 block of North Seventh Street as neighbors consoled the pair’s three children, who were inside when the assailant struck.

Monday’s shooting was San Jose’s 21st and 22nd homicides this year.

If the suspect is spotted, authorities say, people should call 911 and not try to stop him as he is considered armed and dangerous.

					
				

Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Sgt. Stewart Davies or Detective Brian Spears in the San Jose Police Department’s Homicide Unit at 408-277-5283. Those who want to remain anonymous may call Silicon Valley Crime Stoppers at 408-947-STOP (7867) or go to www.svcrimestoppers.org and be eligible for a reward.

	Carolyn Hax: We want our girls-only playground time, and his mom got mad

	PUBLISHED: October 15, 2018 at 6:00 am | UPDATED: October 15, 2018 at 6:35 am

		Lifestyle, Relationships & Advice	



	DEAR CAROLYN: I have a daughter, and some other moms of daughters and I have started getting together at a local playground at a set time each week.
Recently a mom of a boy brought her son to the playground at the same time we were there. I asked her (nicely, I thought) if she would mind leaving because we had wanted it to be a girls-only time. She refused and seemed angry at me.
If she comes back, is there a better way I can approach her? This has been such a sweet time for moms and daughters, and having a boy there is naturally going to change things.

We live in a world where boys get everything and girls are left with the crumbs, and I would think this mom would realize that, but she seems to think her son is entitled to crash this girls-only time. I know I can’t legally keep her from a public park, but can I appeal to her better nature?Playground Drama
DEAR PLAYGROUND: Can I appeal to your better nature?
Goddess help us all.
Shooing off the mom and her boy was terrible. And justifying it as a cosmic correction, for which an innocent child bears the weight? And still trying to do this even after you’ve had time to think about it? Wow.
That kid is a human being — not with privileged little man feelings, either, but with feelings, period. Perhaps even a disposition that fits better into your idea of girl behavior than some of the girls there. People are not widgets. And the adult you shooed off is a mom, possessor of the same crumbs you’ve been fed, no? So don’t you think she would have just liked to hang with some fellow moms in the park?
I mean, maybe not now. I’d avoid you thereafter if it were my kids you boy-shamed … for wanting to play with girls, by the way. As if they were fellow people or something. (How are you with irony?)
If you’re going to have an exclusive gathering, then host it on private property.
And if you’re going to accuse anyone of being “entitled,” then ask yourself who just asked the world to bend to whom.
DEAR CAROLYN:
Re: Girls-Only Playdate
My 5th-grade boy has always gravitated to playing with girls. Please don’t group all boys into a stereotype of being disruptive or playing a different way than girls play. You do kids a disservice by not treating them as the individuals they are.

DEAR CAROLYN:
To: Playground Drama
I have two kids, a boy and a girl, and consider myself an extreme feminist, for whatever that’s worth; I just think that women should be treated like humans, but apparently that’s radical.

Kids are kids. Adults teach them that one sex is different from the other, or only gets to do certain things. You are doing the same, but at the expense of a little boy who wanted to play on a playground.
Apparently Radical
DEAR APPARENTLY: Yes — equality, not payback. Thank you. “If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change.” Gandhi.

						San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia speaks to the media during the first day of class for the police academy at the SJPD southern substation in June, with Mayor Sam Liccardo at left. The 54 recruits of class 30 marks the highest number in a decade. (Gary Reyes/ Bay Area News Group)

“Even if you’re on the right track, you’ll get run over if you just sit there.”  – Will Rogers

When I became mayor two and a half years ago, our police department faced a crisis. While San Jose has long had the most thinly-staffed department of any major U.S. city, the Great Recession, layoffs, pay cuts and battles over pension reform all exacerbated our shortfalls. As a result, San Jose had lost about 600 officers in less than half a decade, and the losses would persist for another year.

Today, we see a different future. With the voters’ approval of Measure F’s pension reform settlement last November, we’ve halted the flight of officers from SJPD while saving more than $42 million this year on retirement costs.
A new police contract and new recruiting approaches appear to be bearing fruit: Our most recent academy boasted 54 new recruits, the most in a decade, and by the end of this year, we will have added more than 100 officers to the force. In addition, we’re seeing substantial reductions this year in homicides and other violent crime.

This resurgence, combined with San Jose’s maintenance of the lowest violent crime rate of any major U.S. city during our leanest years, says much about the character and commitment of hundreds of our officers who stayed on through the back-to-back overtime shifts, canceled family vacations, declining pay and plummeting morale.

It also speaks to the leadership of Chief Eddie Garcia to right the ship, and of his recruiting team, led by Lt. Heather Randol, to revive SJPD’s ability to attract the best and brightest.

While the early results appear promising, we still have a long way to go. Increased media attention on policing nationally has created new challenges to recruiting, so we must continue SJPD’s efforts to broaden its recruiting strategy — such as we’ve seen for young military veterans, LGBT candidates, and for returning SJPD officers — without compromising the department’s high standards.

Those standards are critical: In other cities that have too-eagerly boosted their ranks, communities have suffered the transgressions of rookies lacking the judgment of veteran officers. For that reason, we will sharpen our focus on accountability and on building community trust.

When we deployed body-worn cameras on every patrol officer last year, complaints of officers’ use of force plummeted. Chief Garcia also expanded mandatory training in violence de-escalation, implicit racial bias recognition, and street-level mental health crisis management.

					
				

He’s launched popular “Coffee with a Cop” gatherings, inspiring constructive dialogue in otherwise police-wary neighborhoods. We’ve boosted pay for multilingual officers to improve communication within our diverse community, attracting recruits fluent in eight languages to a recent academy.

Even with these recent gains, police staffing will remain too thin for several years more.  We must continue to think smarter about how we can do more with less.

This requires a focus on crime prevention, such as by expanding our SJ Works program, which provided employment and job skills to more than 1,000 teens living in gang-impacted neighborhoods this year.

We must double down on force-multiplying partnerships, such as District Attorney Jeff Rosen’s community prosecutor initiative that has deterred prostitution in the Washington neighborhood. We’ve doubled the size of our Community Service Officer ranks to improve response and investigation of burglaries and property crime.

Like our Facebook page for more conversation and news coverage from the Bay Area and beyond. 
We also must continue to invest in better technology, as we’ve enhanced officer access to data in the field, added tools like license-plate readers, deployed money-saving fleet telematics, and time-saving predictive analytics.

We’re on the right track, but there’s no time for sitting. Working together, we can rebuild America’s finest police department.

Sam Liccardo is mayor of San Jose. He wrote this for The Mercury News.

						A view of the front of the Claremont Avenue DMV office is seen in Oakland, Calif., on Thursday, May 31, 2018. Certain DMV offices will be open on Saturdays starting in mid-June as the agency struggles to manage long lines of customers waiting to obtain the new Real IDs, and finding themselves stuck in line for hours. (Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group)

PUBLISHED: October 2, 2018 at 1:52 pm | UPDATED: October 2, 2018 at 2:47 pm


First it was the Real ID, that new federal-compliant identification card that spawned soul-sucking lines out the door at DMV offices up and down the Golden State.

Now comes a warning from the state Department of Motor Vehicles that certain unscrupulous online operators have set up websites that charge customers bogus fees to to complete the electronic driver license and ID card application. The heads-up on Tuesday said these fake sites also are charging fees for people trying to get DMV appointments and complete other online transactions.

And when it comes to dealing with the DMV, these ripoff sites only add insult to injury.

The DMV said in its news release that the department has received reports of websites charging customers a fee to complete the new online drivers license application. The agency said its investigations division is looking into the claims for any violation of consumer protection laws. The DMV release added that there are no additional fees to complete the electronic application for a license or for any online services.

“Also,” according to the agency, “there is only one official website for conducting business with the DMV, www.dmv.ca.gov. To avoid paying unnecessary fees, only conduct online transactions on this official website.”



While some unofficial websites might include a disclaimer that they are not, in fact, affiliated with an official government department, these private sites could possibly be giving consumers inaccurate information about DMV services and fees. To make matters worse, the DMV says some of these fraudulent sites include user agreements that allow the operators to access and use customers’ personal information, which they can then turn around and sell to other businesses.

The DMV said any customers trying to conduct online transactions should only type “www.dmv.ca.gov” into their web browser to make sure they are being directed to the agency’s authentic homepage. One more warning: internet search engines may not always list the official DMV website as the top result and unsuspecting consumers can easily wind up clicking their way to a bogus private website.

						A new coat of light color paint can give your room a larger, airier look. (Dreamstime)		
	
By Ap Mcclatchy | wordpress@medianewsgroup.com | 
PUBLISHED: October 8, 2018 at 8:37 am | UPDATED: October 10, 2018 at 8:09 am


Remodeling your bedroom is a great way to revive an outdated space and add value to your home. But like any major home improvement, it’s important to go in prepared — and to plan your budget and design before you get started. Good planning is key not only to saving money, but also to making sure your vision is realized once your project is complete. Consider the following as you plan out your project.

Classic styles work best for resale 

A trendy or personalized design may work well if you’re remodeling for yourself. But if you’re fixing up a bedroom for future resale, a timeless, more traditional style is most likely your best choice. Features like walk-in closets, recessed lighting and an updated bathroom can be good ways to draw in potential homebuyers — while a new bedroom skylight could be the finishing touch you need to close the sale.

Measure twice

One of the biggest mistakes you can make in bedroom remodeling is to take the wrong measurements. Even the smallest of slip-ups can lead to a variety of problems — including potential delays and increased costs that can throw your entire project off course. Be sure to confirm each measurement twice before moving on to the next.

Add more space

Your remodel offers a great opportunity to make your bedroom bigger. Whether that involves building an addition or expanding into an adjacent room, adding more space can improve both the comfort and value of your home. But before you start tearing out the walls, it’s important to know your local zoning laws — and to consult with a pro to better understand which options work best within your budget.

Choose the right flooring 

Wood and carpet are popular bedroom flooring materials. Carpet is the more budget-friendly choice. The downside to carpet is that it can be more difficult to clean and will likely need replacement five to 10 years down the road. Wood flooring is more expensive, but it’s also easy to clean and comes with a longer lifespan. Whichever you go with, be sure to do your research and know your flooring options before making your final decision.

Consider cosmetic upgrades 
Low-budget updates can make a big difference when it comes to changing your bedroom’s appearance. A new coat of light paint can give your room a larger, airier look — while a brighter color combined with different textures can add depth and personality to its overall design. And small things like rearranging the furniture and cleaning up clutter can create the feel of a major upgrade without the project price tag.

Find the right contractor 

When it comes to your remodel, the right contractor makes all the difference. An experienced professional will not only work to keep your project on budget and on schedule, but they will also keep you informed at each phase of the process. As you interview remodelers, be sure to ask plenty of questions, request references and get price estimates whenever possible.

By Bay City News | 
PUBLISHED: May 25, 2017 at 8:09 am | UPDATED: May 31, 2017 at 9:31 am


A man was found dead, apparently of stab wounds, in a San Francisco park Thursday, a police spokesman said.

According to San Francisco police spokesman Sgt. Michael

Andraychak, at 5:30 a.m. police responded to a report of a person on the ground in

Bernal Heights Park.

They found an unresponsive man, and paramedics  declared him dead at the scene, Andraychak said. He was later identified as Giovanny Alvarez, 33.

Further details were not immediately available.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the

San Francisco Police Department’s anonymous tip line at (415) 575-4444 or

send a text to TIP411 and begin the message with SFPD.

SAN JOSE — Hundreds of protesters rallied in front of the soaring Silvery Towers high-rises in downtown San Jose on Thursday, accusing the project’s principal developer, Full Power Properties, of slave labor, human trafficking and wage theft.

About 400 construction workers, including dozens who displayed signs referring to the development as “Slavery Towers,” demanded that Santa Clara County supervisors approve measures to curb what they described as wage theft affecting numerous South Bay workers.

“For two years, we have been loudly expressing our concerns about wage theft at Silvery Towers,” said David Bini, executive director of the Building and Construction Trades Council in Santa Clara County and San Benito County. “We know that workers were exploited, and are being exploited, at Silvery Towers.”

China-based Full Power Properties, which has its local offices in Foster City, dismissed the union rally as a “publicity stunt.”

“Full Power Properties sees this protest as nothing but a misplaced publicity stunt to blame the builder for alleged wrongdoings by a subcontractor over a year ago,” the developer said in a prepared release. “This labor issue was addressed and resolved with the Department of Labor. The union is merely agitating people in an attempt to pressure Full Power to exclusively hire union labor and build its membership on this and future construction projects in San Jose.”

Questionable wage and labor practices at Silvery Towers first surfaced in 2017 when more than a dozen immigrant workers, who authorities said were being held in captivity in a Hayward warehouse, were freed by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Federal prosecutors and Hayward police claimed that Job Torres Hernandez forced his workers at Silvery Towers and other construction projects around the Bay Area to work without pay. Hernandez was indicted on charges of harboring illegal immigrants for commercial advantage or private financial gain.

On July 18, the U.S. Labor Department announced that after its investigation into the pay violations, 22 workers were paid $250,000 by Foster City-based Full Power Properties, the Chinese developer of the 650-unit Silvery Towers project. The department said that when not on the job, those workers had “lived in captivity in squalid conditions in a warehouse” controlled by Job Torres, an unlicensed subcontractor doing business as Nobilis Construction.

“It’s a dark day when slave labor is allowed to happen in San Jose,” Will Smith, a business representative for Local 332 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said during the protest Thursday. “What happened here at Slavery Towers must be exposed.”

					
				

The protest spilled into the street between the two towers and San Pedro Square.

Construction workers urged South Bay politicians to enact the nation’s strongest wage theft and anti-slavery laws and demanded that Santa Clara County’s $950 million affordable housing bond money only go to cities and other jurisdictions that adopt these laws.
“We live in one of the richest locations in the world,” said Ruth Silver Taube, an adjunct professor at Santa Clara University and coordinator of the Santa Clara County Wage Theft Coalition. “Yet every single day, workers are exploited and not paid for their labor.”

Back in June 2016, Bay Area voters approved Measure AA to raise $500 million to pay for wetlands restoration, flood control and wildlife projects around San Francisco Bay. Now the first wave of that money — nearly $18 million — is about to be put to use.

On Wednesday, the board overseeing the money will vote on projects in six counties totaling $17.9 million. They range from $7.4 million to restore former Cargill industrial salt evaporation ponds in Mountain View, Alviso and Hayward, to $450,000 to restore sand dunes, build a trail and clean up debris along Alameda’s shoreline. The projects chosen will affect roughly 2,618 acres.

Another $5 million is expected to be approved later this year for work to restore natural conditions, remove marine debris and create wetlands at a former industrial site along India Basin on the San Francisco waterfront.

“It’s a joyful feeling. We’re beginning the new era in restoring San Francisco Bay,”  said Sam Schuchat, executive officer of the California Coastal Conservancy, an Oakland-based state agency that is helping administer the money. “People voted to tax themselves, which was a bold step. And here we are ready to hand out the first year’s money. It’s pretty exciting.”

Measure AA was the first time that all nine Bay Area counties voted on a single tax measure. The vote, which set the stage for future transportation or housing measures, needed two-thirds overall approval. It received 70 percent.

The money is overseen by the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority, a low-profile government agency that was established in 2008 when former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a law supported by environmental groups and many Bay Area business leaders.

					
				

The $500 million — raised from a $12 per home annual parcel tax over 20 years, is considered a down payment on the estimated $1.5 billion cost to restore — where possible — most of the remaining shoreline areas around the bay back to natural conditions, from hay fields in the North Bay to former salt ponds around Silicon Valley.

From the Gold Rush until the 1970s, San Francisco Bay shrunk by about one-third, due to diking, dredging and filling to build highways, airports, farms and neighborhoods. Although modern environmental laws stopped that practice, scientists, government leaders and local officials have been on a slow campaign to enlarge the bay and bring back fish, wildlife and public access over the past two decades — a mission that also includes restoring wetlands to help protect Bay Area communities from sea level rise as the climate continues to warm.

The restoration authority’s board, which is made up seven local political leaders and chaired by San Mateo County Supervisor Dave Pine, will meet at 11 am Wednesday at the Santa Rosa City Council chambers to vote on the projects.

“There was twice as much money requested as was available. There’s a lot of demand,” said David Lewis, executive director of Save the Bay, an environmental group based in Oakland.

Overall, there were 22 applications totaling $47 million from cities, counties, nonprofit groups and private companies. The winning projects were recommended by the restoration authority board’s 33-member advisory committee and the staffs of the Coastal Conservancy and the San Francisco Estuary Partnership, a coalition of scientists and non-profit groups administered by the Association of Bay Area Governments.

The projects that are recommended for funding are:

	$1.6 million to restore 630 acres of former diked farmland on Montezuma Slough for fish and birds in Suisun Marsh, Solano County.
	$150,000 to the Sonoma Land Trust to develop a plan for restoration, flood protection and public access in the Lower Sonoma Creek portion of the San Pablo Baylands in Sonoma County.
	$6.2 million to Ducks Unlimited and $1.2 million to the California Wildlife Foundation for restoring 620 acres of former Cargill salt ponds off Mountain View, Alviso and Hayward.
	$4.4 million to the Santa Clara Valley Water District for the South San Francisco Bay Shoreline Project in San Jose’s Alviso neighborhood on the bay front. The project, which will cost $174 million, involves construction of new levees and tidal gates, along with restoration of salt ponds. Much of the project is expected to be funded by the federal government and the water district.
	$2.7 million to Point Reyes Bird Observatory, now known as Point Blue Conservation Science, to restore 1.3 miles of degraded shoreline back to wetland habitat in the North Bay in projects involving 5,000 teachers and students over the next five years. The money will be spent to plant thousands of shrubs, grasses and other native plants in San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Sonoma, Solano, and Napa Counties; Pickleweed Park in San Rafael in Marin County; and Shollenberger Park and McNear’s Landing in Petaluma.
	$630,000 to the Marin County Flood Control District to prepare detailed designs, permit applications, and environmental documents to restore 194 acres of tidal baylands and construct nearly a mile of levees at Deer Island, Novato, in Marin County.
	$539,000 to San Leandro to design and obtain permits to convert a 4.3-acre wastewater storage basin adjacent to San Leandro’s Water Pollution Control Plant to wetland and tidal marsh, along with planning for sea level rise in San Leandro.
	$450,000 to the East Bay Regional Park District to remove shoreline debris, restore sand dune habitat and create a new trail and water access at Encinal Beach in the city of Alameda.

TOKYO — The Japanese online retail tycoon who plans to travel to the moon on the SpaceX rocket says he respects and trusts Elon Musk as a fellow entrepreneur, despite his recent troubles.

“Twitter can get you into trouble,” Yusaku Maezawa, chief executive of Zozo, said Tuesday at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Tokyo. “And that can be said of Elon Musk, too.”

Musk’s tweet in August that declared he had secured financing for a Tesla buyout got him in trouble with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under a settlement, Tesla and Musk each must pay a $20 million penalty. Musk also stepped down as Tesla’s chairman.



Maezawa, 42, who is also quite active on social media, intends to be a passenger on Musk’s Space X, the first-ever private commercial space trip, scheduled for blastoff in 2023, to orbit the moon, in what Maezawa has dubbed his “#dearMoon Project.”

Maezawa said he got a good feel for Musk’s character by visiting Tesla, and seeing the relationship Musk had developed with his employees.

“They believe in Elon Musk,” he said. “That kind of company is marvelous. I felt that as another entrepreneur.”

Although Maezawa said nothing was decided yet on who was going with him on the space travel, he said he wanted to take visual artists, fashion designers and musicians from a variety of backgrounds, including the actress he was dating, Ayame Goriki, “if she proves to be a good match for the mission.”

Maezawa said his company has a Twitter policy, and experts go over his tweets in advance. Sometimes he gets emotional on social media, but he is careful not to say anything that might hurt his company, he said.

					
				

Recently, he took to his twitter and Instagram accounts to lash out at online hecklers, who had ridiculed his halting rendition of “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” on an expensive Stradivarius violin he had just purchased.

Maezawa is known for lavish purchases, including artworks by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol. But he is equally known for sharing them with the public.

He shrugged off the possible dangers of space, just as he brushed off the risks of tweets and associations with Musk.

“There is no end if you start thinking about that,” he said of the risks.

Maezawa said he has not yet started training for the mission, but he has been getting regular medical checkups and is brushing up on his English.

In a nation where people tend to be focused on blending in and getting along, Maezawa has stood out. Forbes magazine estimates his wealth at $2.9 billion.

Maezawa ran an import CD business and played in a rock band before he embarked on his online fashion business with his shopping site Zozotown.

Recently, he has begun making clothes, such as a wearable technology called Zozosuit. The suit, splattered with hundreds of dots, takes body measurements with a software application, ensuring a good fit.

Maezawa said nicely fitting clothes bring smiles and the moon trip’s purpose also is to add to happiness.

The world remembers the first words of the 1969 Apollo astronaut Neil Armstrong, “That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,” he said.

Maezawa has a message of his own that he says will be more casual, akin to the lyrics he loved playing in rock bands growing up.
“All I want to say is this: Wouldn’t the world be a better place if there is peace?” said Maezawa.

By Kevin Kelly | kkelly@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: May 30, 2018 at 7:43 pm | UPDATED: May 30, 2018 at 9:20 pm


The Palo Alto City Council authorized the sale of some development rights to help raise most of the money still needed to complete reconstruction of Avenidas and the Junior Museum and Zoo.

The council voted 7-2 to sell roughly 11,700 square feet of “transferable development rights” that could bring anywhere from $3.2 million to $4 million for the ongoing reconstruction projects, which are expected to be done by mid-2020. Under that plan, the city can sell the extra square footage it doesn’t use when restoring historic structures to bidders. Successful bidders then can add that square footage to their downtown projects.

“These are two of our cherished institutions in Palo Alto and it’s really nice to see both projects moving forward,” Councilman Greg Scharff said.

Vice Mayor Eric Filseth and Councilwoman Lydia Kou dissented. Kou said she opposes the Avenidas rebuild, adding “it desecrates the historical aspect of the building.” Filseth said he’s against the city selling zoning rights.

City resident Stephanie Munoz said there are better uses than the Avenidas rebuild for selling transferable development rights. “I think you should rethink that,” Munoz said. “Those development assets should go toward low-income housing. You only get them once.”

The price tag for doubling the Junior Museum’s size and giving it a modern touch recently rose from $25 million to $27 million. The council agreed to pitch in an additional $1 million on top of the $7 million it already contributed to the project. The Friends of the Junior Museum must come up with the other $1 million.

Dick Peery, who donated $15 million to the rebuild, requested that a tree house fort and nets covering the zoo be incorporated in the first phase instead of a later one, even at an additional cost of $2 million. The fort will give children a climbing experience and the netting will provide an open environment for patrons to directly interact with zoo animals, according to the Junior Museum.

Avenidas, the city’s sole provider of comprehensive programs and services for older adults, is undergoing roughly $20 million in repairs, seismic upgrades and a building expansion to handle the city’s growing older population. The 450 Bryant St. building was the city’s original police and fire service facility and has been leased by Avenidas since 1977. The city is contributing $5 million toward that project.

						Patients with severe kidney problems must receive dialysis treatments three times a week. (Bay Area News Group File Photo)		
	
By Mercury News & East Bay Times Editorial Boards | 
PUBLISHED: August 23, 2018 at 6:15 am | UPDATED: August 23, 2018 at 6:24 am


California has a long history of propositions gone awry. Proposition 8 provides a classic example of a ballot measure that has no business being decided by California voters.

The complex initiative designed to regulate the dialysis industry is better suited for the Legislature, where the wording of new laws can be thoroughly vetted and easily altered if problems arise.

Dialysis treatment is a matter of life and death for the 80,000 Californians who receive treatment three times a week in the state’s 588 licensed chronic dialysis clinics. Physicians warn that patients missing even one treatment increase their risk of death by 30 percent.

But the union leaders who launched the initiative to put Prop. 8 on the Nov. 6 ballot wrote a ballot measure that could lead to fewer clinics providing dialysis for patients who critically need the service, according to the independent Legislative Analyst’s Office. Vote no on Proposition 8.

The origin of the measure is no surprise. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has been frustrated with its lack of success unionizing dialysis workers and increasing staffing ratios at clinics. That prompted the flawed strategy of using the threat of a ballot measure as leverage to win concessions from the two California for-profit dialysis firms — DaVita and Fresenius — that dominate the business, providing about 70 percent of the treatments for Californians experiencing kidney failure. The firms stood firm, and SEIU put the issue before voters, where it doesn’t belong.

SEIU representatives argue that the for-profit dialysis firms are engaging in price-gouging and that their profit margins approach 20 percent. Prop. 8 would cap their profits at 15 percent, forcing them to offer rebates to insurance companies at the end of every year if dialysis companies’ margins exceed the cap.

Price-setting for dialysis treatment — like practically all medical procedures in today’s health care world — is complicated. Medicare and Medi-Cal reimbursements for dialysis treatments don’t come close to covering the costs for firms. To offset the losses, dialysis firms charge patients with private insurance a higher rate. The alternative is operating at a loss, which is unsustainable.

					
				

The Legislative Analyst’s Office warns that how state regulators interpret Proposition 8 and how dialysis firms react creates a degree of uncertainty that we find unacceptable. “In some cases,” the LAO report says, “owner/operators might decide to open fewer new CDCs (chronic dialysis clinics) or close some CDCs if the amount of required rebates is large and reduced revenues do not provide sufficient return on investment to expand or remain in the market.”

This would be a devastating development for patients, who could be forced to travel longer distances to receive treatments.
The lack of competition in the dialysis treatment business is troubling, as is the potential for overcharging. But this is a matter that is better suited for the Legislature.

SEIU does not see it that way. Spokeswoman Joan Allen told our editorial board that it uses ballot measures to incentivize companies to change their ways. It sees large policy issues such as Proposition 8 as more appropriate for ballot measures than the Legislature.

We disagree. Ballot measures on policy issues should go before voters only after repeated efforts to pass legislation fail, and even then the wording of a measure often greatly benefits from reviews by supporters and opponents.

Vote no on Proposition 8.

The world just can’t seem to get enough tequila.

It takes about seven years to grow a blue agave plant, the spirit’s prized ingredient. Once mature, tequila makers have to extract the “pina,” or heart, so it can be heated, crushed, fermented, distilled and finally bottled and sold by your local mixologist as part of a trendy cocktail.

But over the last two years, volatile agave prices have soared, thanks in part to high tequila demand. According to an industry survey by Taste Tequila, the plant can cost as much as 25 pesos ($1.31) per kilogram, up from 2 pesos (10 cents) in 2012.

In Jalisco, Mexico, ground zero for growing agave, farmers are struggling to keep up. As these producers pull up premature plants in an effort to cash in while prices are high, quality is beginning to fall. At the same time, the skyrocketing value of the agave has given rise to security concerns as the plants become valuable theft targets. This can add expenses for farmers already gambling with an unpredictably priced crop.

Tequila first made its way out of Mexican artisan distilleries to the urban bar scene in the early 1990s. From 1995 to 2005, tequila production doubled as multinational brands jumped in, generating huge profits while making Patron, Jose Cuervo and Don Julio household names.



Though the spirit’s popularity has grown worldwide, people in the U.S. remain tequila’s top consumers, importing more than 171 million liters in 2017. Spain, the second largest market, brought in about 5 million that year, according to data from the Regulatory Council of Tequila. But keeping up with global demand is getting harder: Agave’s seven-year growth cycle requires a long-term investment for anyone looking to distill. And while some brands source from their own estates, others buy from farmers or do both-leaving much of the industry at the mercy of market prices that swing wildly. Without a locked-in supplier or advance contracts, a brand can easily find itself in trouble if the cost of agave shoots up.

“Agave prices have priced out brands where there’s no estate or distiller,” said Nicolas Palazzi, the owner of craft spirit importer PM Spirits, which has seen 220 percent growth in revenue in the past year, with tequila as a key player.

Patron Spirits International sources exclusively from “agave families,” setting up advance contracts based on predicted needs, said Francisco Soltero, director of strategic planning and public affairs. Tequila Cazadores, owned by Bacardi, operates on a similar model. It makes its own 100 percent blue agave tequila with plants obtained from the same farmers it’s used for decades, said Tania Oseguera, the brand’s Master Tequilier. Agave passing through the distillery right now, Oseguera said, was contracted for seven years ago. The price for the plants fell somewhere between the lows of 2011 and today’s high.

					
				

“We get a deal,” she said.



Tequila brands without a guaranteed agave supply, however, are the most likely to get squeezed out. “Smaller brands are suffering. It’s cleaning out the market,” Palazzi said. As a result, newer brands are trying to navigate the high prices strategically. Playa Real Tequila has already produced award-winning tequila in its first year in business. It works with a distillery that grows about 80 percent of its own agave and buys the rest from outside growers. The company, said President Arturo Vargas, is selling more than it anticipated, so now it’s closely watching the those market prices.

“For us, it’s better to wait for agave prices to go down again,” said Vargas.

Meanwhile, tequila experts complain that the reputation of this unmistakable Mexican spirit is suffering. “As demand increases and tequila becomes a global product, it’s only going to put more pressure on people to use these giant machines to extract as much sugar as possible,” said Josh Prewitt, general manager at La Condesa, a Mexican restaurant in Austin, Texas. He’s referring to the huge “diffusers” loathed by small distilleries but used regularly by bigger companies. “In the industry we call it aga-vodka.”

Just as distillers worry about agave prices spiking, the farmers who produce it are worrying about an unpredictable downturn.
Despite the liquor’s ascendance, the people most responsible for tequila are struggling to survive. Because of agave’s long growth cycle and volatile pricing, many small farmers can’t afford to stay in business when prices swoon. In 2011, there were 3,075 agave producers, according to data from the Committee on Regulation for Tequila. In 2017, there were only 1,946. Simultaneously, tequila production rose, from 261 million liters in 2011 to 271 million liters in 2017.

“Agave producers are a species in extinction,” said Raul Garcia Quirarte, president of the National Committee for the Tequila Agave Product System in an interview during the Food and Beverage Expo in Mexico City in August.

While some agave farmers hold partnerships with tequila companies and are profiting handsomely in the current market, independent growers are forced to gamble, incurring steep expenses without knowing whether prices will be too low when their agave matures, Garcia Quirarte said. Many growers have decided to leave the sector altogether, rather than risk financial ruin, he said.

More direct contracts with distillers would solve these problems, he said, giving small producers peace of mind. He’s hoping the government of Mexico President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a left-leaning politician who swept to power in a landslide, will help facilitate such a transition. Lopez Obrador campaigned on a platform promising security through economic development, especially by revitalizing the rural regions of Mexico.

“We hope the new government helps the production chain-and particularly, the social base of the agave industry,” Garia Quirarte said.

Blaine “Sumo” Sato became known around town as the “Surfers’ Savior.”

The Hawaiian surfing pastor with the long, white beard and big, boisterous laugh lost his battle with colon cancer Sunday, March 11, surrounded by family and friends at his home in Huntington Beach. Sumo, as he was known by most people, was 55.

“He was just the most inspirational guy, it seemed like he closed the gap between good and bad and right and wrong,” said friend Rick “Rockin’ Fig” Fignetti, who got to say goodbye to Sato on Sunday. “It didn’t matter if someone was the mayor or they could be a homeless person — everyone was the same to him. He tried to help everyone out. He just had the biggest heart.”

Sato, a longtime pastor who ran the H20 church out of the International Surfing Museum, also served as the Huntington Beach Marine Safety lifeguard chaplain and in 2016 was inducted into the Surfers’ Hall of Fame at Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway, his imprints reading “TRUST GOD.”

And even in the hardest of times, through the pain that came with the cancer that spread through his body, he did.

“He was one tough guy, he was a warrior,” Fignetti said. “I think of all the pain. I never heard him complain once. He always kept his faith, never said ‘why me’.”

Aaron Pai, owner of Huntington Surf and Sport, added Sato to the Surfers’ Hall of Fame because of his influence on the surfing community.

“He meant everything to me, to our family and to the surfing community. He changed our little world for the better,” Pai said.

					
				

“He was a light. He was just loved by everybody. I call him my best friend, but he’s everybody’s best friend. The words ‘larger than life’ were said about Sumo. He was larger than life. He was Sumo.”

At the induction ceremony, Sato said his placement in the Hall of Fame was a “gift,” and thanked the surfers on the north side of the pier for accepting a transplant from Hawaii.

“It’s unreal, I love this community,” he said. “I’ve learned that when you trust God, all things fall into place.”

After learning about his fight with cancer, he encouraged people to get a colonoscopy regularly. “If I got mine when I was 50,” he said during his induction speech, “I wouldn’t be where I am today.”



Sato wasn’t quiet about his journey — he was open about his struggles early in life in Hawaii’s drug scene.

When he was approached by a missionary who talked to him about Jesus, Sato said, he felt an instant transformation.

He went to church, and members explained to him what he already suspected – that God was putting him on a path.

In 1983, Sato met Raul Ries, who told him about a Bible college in West Covina, and it wasn’t long before Sato packed his bags for the mainland to enroll in the two-year program. He moved back to Hawaii and met another influential figure in the church community, Ralph Moore, who started Hope Chapel in Hermosa Beach and has since started more than 800 churches. Sato became his disciple, helping to open churches on the islands.

Sato wanted to continue his education and moved back to California in 1990 to get his Master of Divinity degree, then spent years moving between Hawaii and California forming churches. At one point, he lived near Wrightwood and had to drive two hours to get to the waves.

He teamed up with the Ettinger family, which includes pro surfer Brad Ettinger, in 2011 and formed H20.

Sato’s role in the surf community was an emotionally difficult one, as he was often called on to officiate at paddle-out ceremonies after a surfer had died. He addressed the crowd of thousands who showed up when three-time world champ Andy Irons – a friend of Sato’s from Hawaii – died in 2010. When Surfline founder Sean Collins died, Sato was the one who comforted thousands of mourners.

“If anything went wrong, he was always there,” Fignetti said. “I’d tell him, ‘You got the toughest job, you have to go there and comfort the people.’ He just embraced it. He said, ‘That’s what I do.'”

Huntington Beach lifeguards a few years ago named Sato one of two official chaplains for the department. When guards need counseling after a drowning, or just wanted someone to talk to, they called on him.

When professional surfer Bethany Hamilton, who lost her arm in a shark attack, earned the “Waterman of the Year” award in Laguna Beach, she asked Sato to address the crowd and talk about how faith helped give her strength.

As his cancer struggle continued, the community rallied. A “Luau of Love” was held in his honor, drawing hundreds of supporters. A surf contest was held in his honor a few months ago.

Fignetti, on Sunday, thanked Sato on behalf of the entire community.

“We’re going to be surfing perfect waves together one day,” he said. “The world without Sumo, it’s never going to be the same. We’ll always keep him in our hearts … you’re the Surfers’ Savior.”

Sato is survived by his wife Diane, daughter Taylor and son Micah.

LONDON — Derek Carr was helpless in the pocket all night, either scrambling for his life, absorbing thud after thud after thud or ducking away from a hand mere inches from his facemask. 

 
The Raiders’ offensive line was dominant in 2016 and well above average in 2017. This year, and especially on Sunday, it has left much to be desired. Against the Seahawks, Carr’s protection was terrible. 

The Raiders’ quarterback weathered 10 hits and six sacks. That’s only one fewer sack than the Raiders have all season. Only once before in his 68-game career had Carr been sacked that many times in a single game, against the Chiefs in Week 17 of the 2015 season. He took less than a handful of deep shots downfield, more than often forced to dump the ball off mere yards from where he stood only because he would’ve been obliterated if he held on any longer. 

The primary detriment in yet another Raiders (1-5) embarrassment, this one a 27-3 drubbing against the Seahawks in London, such shoddy offensive line play raises a major concern in an area that stood as Oakland’s biggest strength not long ago. 

“For me personally, I will not forget this day. I promise you that,” rookie right tackle Brandon Parker said. “I don’t think I’ll ever have a game as bad as this again. I hope they take it like that, too. But that’s just how it is.” 

 


Gone are the days of Donald Penn, Kelechi Osemele, Rodney Hudson, Gabe Jackson and Austin Howard composing one of the best offensive lines in the NFL, if not the best, as the Raiders went 12-4 two seasons ago. Even a 34-year-old Penn at left tackle, the three interior stalwarts and Marshall Newhouse on the right side were more than serviceable in 2017. Carr was sacked 16 times in 2016, good for 34th in the NFL. The Browns alone had three quarterbacks each sacked more times than Carr, Robert Griffin III 22 times, Cody Kessler 21 and Josh McCown 18. Last season Carr was sacked 20 times, tied for 30th in the league. 

Now Penn is on injured reserve with a groin injury, and he wasn’t very good when healthy this season (three games and change) after switching to right tackle. He may never play another NFL snap. All-Pro left guard Kelechi Osemele has missed the last two games with a knee injury. Backup left guard Jon Feliciano suffered a ribs injury early in Sunday’s game and missed the entire second half. 

					
				

“It’s hard, but you can’t make excuses. It’s football,” Hudson said. “It’s always different when there’s so many new guys in.”

On Sunday Carr had a rookie left tackle in Kolton Miller hobbled by a right knee injury the last two games, a rookie right tackle in Brandon Parker who’s started two career games, a third-string left guard in Justin Murray and Hudson and Jackson. The result? A misty night in front of almost 85,000 people that saw Carr seemingly on his back as much as he stood on two feet. 

“That was my first real action in a football game, so I was trying to do everything I can not to make a mistake,” Murray said. “But if you think about not making a mistake, that’s when you make the most … There’s a saying, ‘next man up.’ Next guy just has to be ready and when the opportunity is right there for you, you just gotta be ready.” 

Carr doesn’t exactly thrive under pressure – entering Sunday Carr had six interceptions and no touchdowns when pressured this season, with his 37.3 passer rating under pressure ranking 32nd of 36 qualifying quarterbacks according to Pro Football Focus – and against the Seahawks that pressure never relented. 

Late in the first quarter, Seahawks defensive end Frank Clark burned Miller on the outside before sacking Carr, forcing a fumble the Seahawks recovered. Then again early in the third quarter, Clark bulldozed over Miller, forcing another Carr fumble the Seahawks again recovered. To top off the Raiders’ misery, Carr’s last two snaps of the game both ended with him lying on the grass after sacks Nos. 5 and 6. 

The second injured Carr’s left arm, it seemed, and he entered the sideline medical tent before spending five minutes asking Gruden to put him back in. Gruden refused – the Raiders never got the ball back for the final 8:18 anyway – but AJ McCarron would’ve played. Carr might’ve gotten killed if he stepped foot back on the field. 

“As a player, you always are against it, but when you’re on the other side of things you obviously agree 100 percent,” Carr said. “It makes sense, right? Especially with how things were going. 

“There were times I thought our O-line did a great job. I think they fought their tails off and I was able to look for things downfield. They were just playing so deep, abnormally, that we had to check it down a lot, and that makes it tough on the O-line. I think there were a lot of circumstances that made it tough on them, but I’m not worried about them at all. It was a rough day. It was hard.” 

So where does the Raiders’ offensive line go from here, besides to their respective homes for the upcoming bye week?

The Raiders will probably get Osemele back for a Week 8 matchup with the Colts in Oakland, and Miller will have time to heal his right knee, too. Hudson, Jackson and Parker will still be there, and the Raiders’ once-sturdy offensive line will have an extra week to make sure such an abominable performance doesn’t happen again. 

“Well it really wasn’t close today. You know, we didn’t get an opportunity to step up in the pocket and go through the progressions. It was closing in quick,” Gruden said. “Derek was on the run a lot and he got hit too much. We can’t allow that to happen. We just can’t do it.”

By Karen D'Souza | kdsouza@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: September 11, 2018 at 6:45 am | UPDATED: September 11, 2018 at 6:56 am


So much for keto and cleanses, intermittent fasting is the latest hot diet that’s got pop culture buzzing. From Beyonce to Ben Affleck, all the celebrities seem to be doing it. Even Dr. Oz swears by it. But don’t worry, it’s not a bread-and-water only fast. On this diet you get to worry less about what you eat and more about when you eat. Every day is supposed to have a long period of time with no food, but the length of that period varies depending on which plan you follow.

There is some evidence that a diet of intermittent fasting may help you live longer. As USA Today reported, scientists from the National Institute on Aging, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana found that increasing the time between meals improved overall health and lengthened lives in a study of mice. The benefits were seen regardless of what the mice ate or how many calories they consumed. That’s one of the reasons this diet is gaining popularity with people, too. You pretty much get to eat whatever you like. (Within reason.)

Here’s how a 12/12 fast, one of the easiest to follow versions of the intermittent fasting method, works. Once you stop eating at night, you make sure to wait 12 hours until you eat again. So if you finish dinner at 9 p.m., you don’t eat breakfast until 9 a.m.The perk of this diet is that it is flexible. If you have a late party to go to, you can just push back your start time.

It’s all in the timing. One of the most popular versions of intermittent fasting is the “early time-restricted feeding,” or the 16/8 method, where all meals are fit into an early, eight-hour period of the day (9 to 5, for instance). Researchers from the University of Alabama conducted a study with a small group of obese men with pre-diabetes comparing  8-hour eaters with those who spread out food over 12 hours. After five weeks, the eight-hour group had dramatically lower insulin levels and significantly improved insulin sensitivity as well as significantly lower blood pressure.

It should be noted that while fasting may be trendy, it is far from new. Most religions have long maintained that fasting is good for the soul. Its physical benefits were already well known by the early 1900s, when doctors began using fasting to treat various disorders—such as diabetes, obesity and epilepsy, as Scientific American points out. In some cultures and countries, such as India, it is considered a sacred practice.

No matter what hours you pick, most health experts advise sticking to sound nutritional wisdom: Avoid sugars and refined grains and eat lots of fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Also be as active as possible throughout the day and avoid eating at bedtime, as the Harvard Health Blog notes.

By Washington Post | 
PUBLISHED: October 15, 2018 at 10:44 am | UPDATED: October 15, 2018 at 10:47 am


By Robert McCartney | The Washington Post

Austin Hong of San Diego has used Airbnb and similar companies for the past five years to rent out a second home for short stays. The income allows him and his husband to cover the mortgage while keeping the three-bedroom house available for family members who visit often.

So Hong fought back when the city council passed a law in July that would ban such short-term rentals. He collected signatures on petitions at food courts and social gatherings as part of a successful campaign to block the law from taking effect until it can be put to popular referendum, possibly in 2020.

“They say it’s regulation, but really it’s a ban that they passed,” said Hong, 34, who is creative director at a software company. “We absolutely want regulation. What we don’t want is a ban.”



The explosive growth of short-term rentals around the country has pushed ocal governments to rein in the practice, with help from the hotel industry, which wants to stifle a formidable competitor.

But the effort has spawned political contests that have highlighted the difficulty of managing a disruptive new industry. It has triggered a backlash in some jurisdictions from the short-term rental firms and property owners who don’t want to lose a lucrative enterprise.

In June, voters in Palm Springs, California, overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure overturning limits on short-term rentals. Some state governments, such as Tennessee and Arizona, have intervened to protect hosts when legislators thought cities were setting limits that went too far.

In Washington, the tug-of-war is scheduled to reach a climax Tuesday with a second District of Columbia Council vote expected to approve some of the toughest restrictions in the country. They would ban short-term rentals of a second home–a measure that has proved to be the single most divisive provision in debates across the country.

As in many other cities, the District of Columbia bill would allow property owners to rent out space in their primary residence when the host is present, and for a specified period – up to 90 days a year in Washington – when the host is absent.

					
				

These kinds of new restrictions – in scores of cities in the U.S. and hundreds worldwide – have barely slowed the rise in home-sharing. It is forecast to continue to expand rapidly and permanently transform the lodging and tourism business.

Short-term rentals have soared because hosts like the extra income and guests get alternatives, often at a lower price, to a hotel or motel. Matching the two has become much easier because bookings can be done online on Airbnb, HomeAway, VRBO and other sites.

The expansion aroused fear in the lodging industry, whose companies and unions have financed and promoted tight regulation of what they describe as “illegal hotels.” They have formed an alliance with citizens unhappy that short-term rentals are altering their neighborhoods” residential character, and affordable housing activists. They make claims, based on inconclusive data, that growth of short-term rentals is contributing significantly to housing shortages and rising rents.

“The real story over the last year or year and a half seems to be the hotel industry waking up to the fact that Airbnb poses a much bigger threat to their business than they originally imagined,” said Anu Sundararajan, a New York University business professor.

He noted that on the most recent New Year’s Eve, more than 3 million guests were staying in Airbnb rooms, or more than the total number staying in hotels owned by Marriott and Hilton combined.

The regulations have established a legal framework for the new industry, which in many cities was operating in violation of zoning laws or other ordinances. They also have allowed local governments to collect taxes on short-term rentals. Airbnb says about 60 percent of its U.S. hosts now pay such levies.

“We’re encouraged to see places like San Diego, Boston and New York moving forward with regulations holding Airbnb and their counterparts accountable for fostering illegal hotel activity, which is really affecting quality of neighborhoods and housing affordability across the country,” Troy Flanagan, vice president of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, said.

But the new regulations are barely slowing down the nascent industry. Global short-term rentals grew by 82 percent from 2012 to 2017, from 45.6 billion to 82.9 billion, according to a July report by Skift, a travel industry research firm. In the same period, hotel room sales increased 27 percent, from 404.2 billion to 512.3 billion.

By 2022, Skift forecast, short-term rentals sales will jump 60 percent from the 2017 level, to 132.5 billion rooms, while hotel room sales will rise by 34 percent to 686.9 billion.

It seems likely that short-term rentals would have grown even faster without the new regulations, but no figures are publicly available about how many listings were lost overall because of the new rules. In San Francisco, Airbnb reported in January that some of the tightest restrictions in the county had cost it nearly 5,000 listings.

Regulation can actually help encourage short-term rentals, according to the industry, because it legitimizes the activity and attracts interest. Also, it’s so difficult to enforce many regulations that home-sharing continues even if it’s technically illicit.

“The more heavy handed and draconian the regulations that cities try to impose, the more complicated it is for them to enforce,” Matthew Kiessling, vice president of the Travel Technology Association, said.

But cities accuse the short-term rental companies of making enforcement difficult by declining to share data about who is listing properties.

In Portland, a city audit in August found that nearly 80 percent of listed rentals were operating without the mandatory city permit. City officials complained their hands were tied because they lacked data.

“It’s still very challenging to have what I would call smart regulation, because it depends on data, and data is largely held by the companies, and the companies are largely not super-interested in sharing the data,” said Kellen Zale, a University of Houston law professor.

She and other analysts said the research is inconclusive about whether the short-term rental business is contributing to shortages of affordable housing.

“I’ve seen various studies, and they point in different directions,” Zale said. “We haven’t really got good evidence.”

Despite the bitter battle over regulation, some common ground exists. The short-term rental companies agree with the hotel industry that owners should be banned from having multiple listings. The hotel industry says it’s fine with what it calls “true” home-sharing, in which hosts rent space in their primary residence when they’re present.

The biggest challenge has been whether to allow short-term rentals of second homes. Seattle, Denver and Phoenix say “yes,” while San Francisco and New York have largely banned the practice.

The question resonates in San Diego, a seaside city with thousands of vacation homes that have been rented out on a short-term basis for generations.

Blaine Smith owns a company that manages 150 vacation homes.All but two or three of the properties are second homes, which could not be rented under the proposed law.

“As written, it would pretty much put us out of business,” Smith, 32, said. “We have such a rich history of tourism and vacation rentals. It’s just crazy what happened here.”

	Kurtenbach: Jimmy Garoppolo needs to find his mojo — before it’s too late for the 49ers

					San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo (10) lowers his head as he sits on the bench while playing the Detroit Lions in the second quarter of their NFL game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday, Sept. 16, 2018. (Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group)
				

SANTA CLARA — Jimmy Garoppolo is in a unique spot.
On one hand, he’s a 26-year-old quarterback with only nine NFL starts to his name. He’s unquestionably talented, but he’s learning how to be successful at the highest level.
On the other hand, Garoppolo has the third-largest contract in the NFL and was anointed the 49ers’ franchise savior after his transcendent play led the team to a 5-0 end to the 2017 season.


These concepts seem contradictory, but make no mistake, Garoppolo inhabits both camps at the moment.
And this week, he’s going to pick a side — whether he likes the result or not.
(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) So much has been made of the Chiefs’ incredible second-year quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, and Kansas City’s potent offense that the team’s abysmal defense has been overlooked.
The Chiefs have the worst defensive DVOA in football after two weeks, allowing a whopping average of 508 yards and 32.5 points per contest (both last in the NFL, but a significant margin.)
Quarterbacks Philip Rivers of the Chargers and Ben Roethlisberger of the Steelers weren’t able to beat the Chiefs in the first two weeks of the season, but they were able to rack up yards in bunches and score a bunch of points against Kansas City.
Call it simplistic thinking if you want, but Garoppolo needs to follow suit Sunday when the Niners play the Chiefs in Missouri.

Because as much as Garoppolo is a young, learning quarterback, you can’t forget paid better than both of those future Hall of Famers (Rivers will have more career passing yards than John Elway by the end of the month) — fair or not, that holds Garoppolo to a higher standard. This week, Garoppolo needs to prove that he’s at least close to those quarterbacks’ class, and, again, there’s no better opportunity to do that than playing Kansas City.
So far this season, Garoppolo has been less-than-inspiring at the helm of the 49ers’ offense. Against arguably the league’s best defense, Minnesota, in Week One, he threw three interceptions, and then he nearly threw away the 49ers’ win over the Lions last week, only for his late fourth-quarter interception to be called back because of a penalty away from the play.
It’s only two weeks — a small sample size, no doubt — but Garoppolo is ranked No. 26 in quarterback DVOA and has the 21st best Pro Football Focus rating.
Or, in other words, despite an entire offseason to fully learn Kyle Shanahan’s playbook and arguably with more talent around him, Garoppolo hasn’t shown any appreciable growth year-over-year.
That’s not what the 49ers’ signed up for. That’s not what 49ers fans expected after last season.
(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) Garoppolo’s trajectory and the 49ers’ are inseparable, and right now, it’s easy to misplace all that preseason optimism that surrounded both the quarterback and his team.
Shanahan, to his credit, seemed to understand that Wednesday, though he unsurprisingly disagrees with my assessment that Garoppolo faces a prove-it game Sunday.
“Jimmy has the ability to do everything and to be very good, and he has shown that. But, hasn’t played a lot of football. It’s going to be a long year. We’re two games into this. Some games are going to be really good, some aren’t and some are going to be right in the middle,” Shanahan said. “When you do have the success that Jimmy had last year, when you do get that big contract off of limited sample size, when he does really good I think people are going to make a little bit too big a deal of it and I think when he doesn’t do really good, I think we’re all going to make a little bit too big a deal off of it, also. I try to stay just even-keeled with it, balanced, and try to continue to coach him.”
Yes, slow and steady wins the race, but that’s a lot easier to say when the racer isn’t being paid $37 million this year.
And while no one is coming to take Garoppolo’s job, and he certainly didn’t ask for the hype around him, it time for Garoppolo needs to inspire once again.
Garoppolo doesn’t even need to beat the Chiefs on Sunday, nor does he have to put up a better game than Mahomes. But he needs to look the part of a Top-10 NFL quarterback.
Because if Garoppolo can find his mojo against this porous Chiefs defense, it could jumpstart the season for the 49ers.
San Francsico plays the Chargers in Los Angeles in Week Four (a quasi-home game for the Niners), pitting Garoppolo in a quarterback duel with Rivers. Then, two weeks after that, he’ll (presumably) face off against Aaron Rodgers on the road on Monday Night Football.
You don’t want to be going into those games with anything less than full confidence. That’s a formula that leaves the 49ers with a 2-4 record and dashed playoff hopes. The 49ers simply don’t have the talent to overcome mediocre quarterback play.
(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) If Garoppolo is the real deal – despite the highs of last year, the jury is still out on that — now’s the time to start some momentum. The first two games of 2018 are forgivable — early-season rust and sluggishness — but a poor performance against these Chiefs simply is not.
And while three games isn’t a large sample size, but it’s nearly 20 percent of the season. That’s a large enough sample to consider it a trend.
Now, I don’t think Garoppolo is “all scheme”, and I certainly don’t think he has anything resembling elite offensive talent around him.
But a quarterback who signed a $137.5 million contract (which, for your edification, has a team-friendly out after next season) doesn’t get sympathy. Garoppolo was brought in last year and quickly proved himself to have transcendent talent.
And this weekend, he needs remind everyone what that kind of talent looks like.

By Dan Walters, CALmatters | 
PUBLISHED: September 2, 2018 at 6:03 am | UPDATED: September 3, 2018 at 4:41 am


California’s booming economy is pouring many billions of additional tax dollars into state and local government treasuries.

Nevertheless, the locals – cities and school districts, especially – find themselves in an ever-tightening fiscal vise because mandatory payments into public employee pension funds are growing much faster than revenues.

That’s why dozens of them are asking their voters this year to approve new taxes, although they typically, for political reasons, don’t specify pensions as the reason.

Laws governing those tax elections, however, are in a state of legal flux.

The state constitution separates local tax proposals into those meant for general purposes and those for specially designated purposes. It allows simple majority voter approval of the former and requires two-thirds voter approval for the latter.

Last year, the state Supreme Court shook up those provisions, implying in a Southern California marijuana case that if special purpose tax measures are placed on the ballot by initiative petition, rather than by the local governments themselves, the two-thirds vote threshold might not apply.

The ruling was not definitive, but ever since it was issued, those in the cloistered world of local government finance have speculated about its potential effects. Everyone’s been waiting for a test case and it might be a special property-related tax approved by San Francisco voters on June 5.

Measure C, placed on the ballot by an initiative petition sponsored by members of the city’s Board of Supervisors and approved by 51 percent of its voters, imposes a 3.5 percent tax on local commercial rents, such as office buildings, and a 1 percent tax on warehouse rents.

Entitled “Universal Childcare for San Francisco Families,” the measure dedicates tax proceeds to child care and early childhood education.

					
				

Commercial property owners and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association sued, contending that Measure C is clearly a special tax, since its proceeds are designated for one purpose, and thereby needed a two-thirds vote.

It’s evident that tax sponsors see it as a way of converting the Supreme Court’s earlier implication into rock-solid case law, thus making it easier to enact new local taxes. And just as clearly, Jarvis and other plaintiffs in the suit see it as a potential erosion of the constitution’s two-thirds vote requirement for special taxes.

Thus, the die appears to be cast for a legal showdown. But wait, as the TV peddlers say, there’s more.

As the San Francisco suit was being launched, the state Supreme Court issued another ruling regarding a pension reform initiative sponsored by former San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders in 2012 and overwhelmingly approved by the city’s voters.

City employee unions waged a legal battle to overturn the measure and won a ruling by the state Public Employee Relations Board that said Sanders was acting as a city official when he sponsored the initiative, not as an ordinary citizen.

Therefore, the board said, as mayor, Sanders was legally obligated under state labor law to “meet and confer” with unions on something that affected their members’ compensation. The Supreme Court upheld the board’s ruling.

Logically, if Sanders was under that legal obligation as an official, then members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors also were acting officially, and not as ordinary citizens, when they sponsored Measure C. If so, they were placing a special tax on the ballot that would require a two-thirds vote.

Logic does not always prevail in legal battles, but the outcome of this one will reverberate for decades to come.

ST. LOUIS–As the season winds down, the book on the 2018 Giants is almost ready for publication. 

 
Some of the chapters focus heavily on injuries and others on the team’s offensive failures. While the end of the plot has yet to play out, the paragraphs written about what’s transpired in St. Louis this weekend will focus on the promise of the future and concerns of the present. 

While young Giants continued to showcase their potential Saturday, a veteran under contract for two more years served up the walk-off home run in a 5-4, 10-inning defeat. 

For the second straight day, right-hander Mark Melancon took the loss as he threw a hanging breaking ball that Cardinals right fielder Tyler O’Neill crushed over the wall. 

“If I execute that pitch, then I’m comfortable with it,” Melancon said. 



Melancon didn’t execute and it cost the Giants a chance to snap a nine-game road losing streak against National League Central teams. 

May 26 (Chicago) was the last time the Giants beat an NL Central club on the road, and that came before rookie Dereck Rodríguez joined the team. Rodríguez started Saturday’s game in St. Louis, firing six innings of two-run ball before disaster struck in the bottom of the seventh. 

After Rodríguez walked Cardinals third baseman Jedd Gyorko on four pitches, veteran catcher Yadier Molina slammed a game-tying two-run homer to snap an impressive streak for the rookie pitcher. Prior to allowing four earned runs Saturday, Rodríguez had surrendered three runs or fewer in 16 straight outings including 15 starts. 

					
				

“It doesn’t matter the situation, he goes after hitters,” Joe Panik said. “He has a presence on the mound. Almost just a calmness.” 

Panik became the eighth different Giants player to start at first base this season, making his professional debut at the position Saturday against Cardinals right-hander Adam Wainwright. A slew of injuries wiped out the Giants’ first base depth, so Panik played there for the first time since his T-ball team needed his services. 

Manager Bruce Bochy said he wanted to load his lineup with lefties against Wainwright and play Panik and Alen Hanson at the same time, so the duo formed the starting combination on the right side of the infield. 

Panik produced like a first baseman at the plate, piling up three hits and adding a walk in Saturday’s defeat. 

“You’ve got to get creative,” Bochy said. “Our first baseman is down. We really don’t have a first baseman right now.” 

With Brandon Belt, Buster Posey, Pablo Sandoval and Ryder Jones all sidelined due to season-ending injuries, rookie Aramis Garcia has earned most of the starts at first base over the last week. After finishing 0-for-4 with four strikeouts Friday, Garcia moved from the corner of the infield to behind the plate so he could catch Rodríguez in St. Louis. 

Garcia grew up a Cardinals fan, but disappointed the home crowd at Busch Stadium by picking up four hits including a two-run single that pushed the Giants ahead 4-2 in the top of the seventh. Prior to Saturday, no rookie had recorded four strikeouts and followed with four hits in their next game since Andre Ethier of the Dodgers accomplished the feat July 2-3, 2006.

“That’s just the beauty of baseball, right?” Garcia said. “You have nights like that and you just go home and remind yourself that you get to come back tomorrow and do it again.” 

A Florida native, Garcia split time catching with Rodríguez on the same travel ball team as 13-year-olds. Both players have long admired Molina, but their appreciation for the Cardinals catcher developed in different ways. 

“It was crazy, I honestly don’t even know what to say, it was surreal getting to face him today,” Garcia said. 

If Molina continues playing through the end of his contract, Garcia could have several more opportunities to face him as he’s establishing himself as a regular contributor for the Giants. Though Garcia began the season at Double-A Richmond, he’s ending it in San Francisco where he’s opened his career with 14 hits in 38 at-bats. 

Garcia could carve out a spot as a backup catcher on next year’s Opening Day roster, which will certainly feature Rodríguez who emerged as the Giants’ best player in 2018. While Rodríguez will have a final chance to close his rookie season on a high note against the Dodgers, he couldn’t help but express frustration at the way his day ended. 

“He’s one of the best,” Rodríguez said of Molina, a friend of his father Ivan’s. “He knows what he’s doing. I’m sure he knew a curveball was coming.”

						Los Altos senior Elliott Samuels finished school a semester early to play in Europe this winter. 		
	
By Peter Allen | 
PUBLISHED: December 13, 2007 at 9:27 am | UPDATED: August 14, 2016 at 6:23 am


Elliott Samuels netted over 100 goals during this year’s water polo season. But the senior from Los Altos High does not obsess over the exact figure. He believes winning requires more than just a scoring touch.


   “It’s just as important to save a goal as it is to score one,” Samuels said. “If you want to contribute as much as you can to your team, you have to focus on improving your game on offense and on defense.”


   Listed as a driver on the roster, Samuels excelled at both ends of the pool and everywhere in between for Los Altos, which took home the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League De Anza Division title.


   The Eagles fell to eventual champion Menlo-Atherton in a double-overtime Central Coast Section Division I quarterfinal.


   “He really is a complete player,” said Ed Samuels, who is Elliott’s father and the Los Altos coach. “He’s our most potent offensive threat, an excellent defender at two meters, a great passer and a great playmaker.”


   Elliott Samuels played for two years at Sacred Heart Prep in Atherton before transferring to Los Altos for his junior year. The move allowed him to play alongside close friend Connor Smith.


   “We’d always played against each other before, so it was a nice change,” Samuels said. “Knowing him and having that relationship helped me ease into a new environment.”


   Their affinity translated directly into the pool, where the two proved a dynamic scoring tandem. Smith added to Samuels’ prolific tally with over 80 goals of his own.


   Samuels was also named MVP of the SCVAL De Anza Division.

It seemed like a nice idea. Last fall, an older and supposedly more mature Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber rekindled their childhood romance following her kidney transplant surgery and his reported efforts to re-focus on his faith.

But happily ever after? Apparently not, with reports coming in that the pop lovebirds are taking a break — and possibly for good.

“They’re supposedly taking a break,” a source told Page Six. “She has trust issues. He has trust issues. There’s a lot going on there. They do this all the time. They get into arguments.”

Another source added to People that their “break” has nothing to do with Gomez’ mom, Mandy Teefey, who has made it clear she didn’t approve of her 25-year-old daughter getting back together with Bieber, who just turned 24.

“They’re not on a break because of her relationship with her mom,” a source said about the couple. “They have their own issues and are always on and off. She wouldn’t base her relationship off of what her mom thinks.”

Earlier this year, Teefey told People she was “not happy” about the rekindled romance, but added that “Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy.”

Reports started circulating in the fall that Gomez and Bieber had mended fences. The “Wolves” singer had also recently split from The Weeknd. Gomez and Bieber dated on and off from 2011 to 2014.

“(Selena) is someone I love dearly,” Bieber told Access Hollywood in 2015. “I’m never going to stop loving her. I’m never going to stop checking in on her. … We always respected each other and we still respect each other.”

Gomez underwent a kidney transplant earlier this year due to complications of lupus. Beieber reportedly offered his ex-girlfriend a shoulder to lean on. Over the next few months, the two often were seen together at church, or hanging out around Los Angeles.

“Justin and Selena recently started speaking,” a source told Us Weekly in October. “It’s because of the same church they go to. The community there is pretty tight-knit and Justin and Selena have a lot of mutual friends who brought them back together. They realized it was time to grow past their history and move on. They’re grown up a lot in the past couple of years and are mature about the situation.”

Still, Gomez and Bieber never publicly defined themselves as a couple again.

							Delphi Trio

						The Delphi Trio is among the scores of performers, representing classical and contemporary genres, lined up for S.F. Music Day Sept. 30.		
	
By Andrew Gilbert | Correspondent
PUBLISHED: September 25, 2018 at 8:30 am | UPDATED: September 25, 2018 at 8:44 am


There’s no event in the Bay Area quite like S.F. Music Day. Produced by InterMusic SF (formerly San Francisco Friends of Chamber Music), the free all-day festival fills the War Memorial Building to the brim with top Bay Area ensembles representing early music, chamber music, new music, jazz, and music inspired by global classical and folk traditions.

With three dozen combos on tap it’s a dizzying, non-stop flow of sound that allows listeners to wander from the august Herbst Theatre to the elegant Green Room to the spacious Atrium Theater to the intimate Education Studio with nary a musical pause.



The theme of the 11th annual Music Day is Colors of the Keyboard, which in keeping with the more-is-more tenor of the event means not just pianos, but electric organs, harpsichords, the accordion-like bandonéon, and other keyed instruments. There are far too many groups participating to list them all but the roster includes the Delphi Trio, Firesong, and Circadian String Quartet covering chamber music; Luminance Ensemble, the Redwood Tango Ensemble, and Earplay representing contemporary music; and early music offerings such as Agave Baroque, Liaison Ensemble, and MUSA.

Jazz and improvised music are particularly well represented with 14 diverse acts, from pianist Motoko Honda’s Simple Excesses and tenor saxophonist George Brooks’ global Aspada to guitarist David James’ funky GPS and the volatile Lisa Mezzacappa Six.

The event also features a world premiere by Emmy Award-winning composer and bassist Mark Izu. Commissioned by the San Francisco Arts Commission and presented by First Voice and the Center for Asian American Media (CAAM), “Japanese American Home Movies to Light” is the latest collaboration between Izu and dramatist/storyteller Brenda Wong Aoki. The multimedia work features films drawn from the archival collection of filmmaker and CAAM Executive Director Stephen Gong and an ensemble playing traditional Asian and Western instruments.

Details: noon to 8 p.m.; free; 415-967-3326, www.intermusicsf.org.

						Alameda’s Leah Bartolome (3) returns a serve against Bishop O’Dowd during a volleyball match at Alameda High in Alameda, Calif., on Thursday, Sept. 13, 2018. (Ray Chavez/Bay Area News Group)		
	
By Gordon Kass and Jim Changaris | Correspondent
PUBLISHED: September 18, 2018 at 1:14 pm | UPDATED: September 18, 2018 at 4:49 pm


Central Coast Section

The Durango Fall Classic tournament in Las Vegas featured top schools from around the country, including seven of prepvolleyball.com’s national top 10 and 19 of the top 100.

CCS teams did not fare well in the 64-team tournament.

Sacred Heart Cathedral came in at No. 30, Notre Dame Belmont tied for No. 31, Mitty was No. 37 and St. Ignatius tied for No. 39. Eleven Southern California teams finished higher than SHC and remember that when the CIF state tournament kicks off in mid-November.

Closer to home, the Chris Chandler tournament at Menlo School featured parity. Palo Alto topped Menlo-Atherton but the Vikings lost to Sacred Heart Prep. SHP lost to rival Menlo School but the Knights fell to M-A. The champion was the M-A Bears, as they jumped past their early pool play defeat to roll through bracket play and beat Menlo 25-20, 26-24 for the title behind 8 kills each from Alicia Letvin and Emma Spindt.

A shocking result came in from the WCAL last week, as SHC crushed Mitty 25-13, 25-15, 25-17. The Monarchs did rebound to deal St. Francis a 4-set thumping, 25-23, 20-25, 25-20, 25-19.

Menlo-Atherton chalked up big PAL wins by defeating Woodside, Carlmont and Hillsdale.

In the SCVAL, Mountain View belted Los Gatos but the Spartans fell to league-leading Palo Alto.

League look:

					
				

WCAL: SHC and SI are both 2-0.

WBAL, Foothill Division: League play just beginning.

SCVAL, DeAnza Division: Paly on top at 3-0.

BVAL, Mt. Hamilton Division: Leigh, Branham, and Westmont lead the way with 2-0 records.

Upcoming: The City rivalry of SHC and SI takes place on Tuesday night.

North Coast Section

James Logan is red hot. In the power-packed Durango Tournament (see above), the Colts fell just 25-15, 25-22 to Mater Dei, who finished No. 3 overall. James Logan then ripped off four straight victories, beating Arbor View-Las Vegas and Flintridge Sacred Heart-La Canada in pool play, O’Connor-Phoenix in the Qualifying Round and Skyridge-Lehi, Ut. in the Bronze Bracket before falling to Marin Catholic and Village Christian-Sun Valley to end the tournament with an impressive No. 21 ranking.

EBAL rivals Foothill and Cal banged heads in the East County Invitational tournament final, with Cal prevailing 23-25, 25-23, 15-12.

Liberty tipped Heritage 25-18, 24-26, 25-17, 25-21 in a key BVAL match. The Lions were led by Delaney Gash with 10 kills and Alicia Bustamante with 15 assists.

Kudos to Monte Vista for nipping Amador Valley 25-19, 19-25, 18-25, 25-19, 15-9 and knocking the Dons from the unbeaten ranks.

A quick rundown of each top league, with a championship prediction:

TCAL: Pinole Valley (7-0) leads the way, with Bethel, Salesian College Prep, Albany, and St. Patrick – St. Vincent right behind. Prediction: St. Patrick – St. Vincent.

West Alameda County, Foothill Division: Encinal, Berkeley, and Bishop O’Dowd are the early leaders. Prediction: O’Dowd

Mission Valley Athletic League: James Logan is alone in first. Prediction: Hammer time – no one can touch James Logan.

Bay Valley Athletic League: Pittsburg and Liberty are 2-0. Prediction: The Liberty Lions will roar.

East Bay Athletic League: Foothill, Amador Valley, and Cal are tied at the top with 7-1 records. Prediction: Cal

Diablo Athletic League, Foothill Division: League play about to start. Prediction: Campolindo.

Bay Counties League, East Division: Head-Royce sits alone in first place with a 7-0 mark. Prediction: Head-Royce.

						Jazz educator Dave Eshelman is rounding up the members of his Jazz Garden band for a 40th anniversary concert at Yoshi’s.		
	
By Andrew Gilbert | Correspondent
PUBLISHED: October 10, 2018 at 11:00 am | UPDATED: October 10, 2018 at 11:07 am


He didn’t know it at the time, but when trombonist/composer Dave Eshelman brought his recently formed orchestra into downtown San Jose’s Eulipia Café in the fall of 1978, it was the start of something big. The Jazz Garden Big Band turned into one of the Bay Area’s premiere large ensembles, a talent-packed aggregation that recorded four acclaimed albums and collaborated with jazz giants Mel Tormé and Joe Henderson. While the band hasn’t performed regularly in years, Eshelman keeps its legacy current by rounding up the illustrious cast for milestone-marking events, like the 40th anniversary concert at Yoshi’s on Monday.

The Jazz Garden moniker couldn’t be more apt. As an inveterate educator who has run numerous jazz programs around the region, Eshelman is a widely esteemed jazz educator. The seeds he’s planted have blossomed in musical fields around the country. Jazz Garden saxophonist Bob Kenmotsu, drummer Alan Hall, trombonist Jeanne Geiger, bass trombonist Rich Lee, trumpeters Mike Olmos and Marvin McFadden and pianist/accordionist Colin Hogan are all former Eshelman students. Monday’s show also features saxophonist Mary Fettig, trumpeter Louis Fasman, guitarist Randy Vincent and saxophonist and wood flute expert Dann Zinn, who holds Eshelman’s former position as director of Jazz Studies at Cal State East Bay. They’ve all played Eshelman’s music for decades.

“The thing that’s most gratifying is how long I’ve known some of these people, and they still talk to me,” Eshelman says. “I met Alan Hall when was a junior at Pioneer High School in San Jose. He came and played with my band at San Jose City College. Each of these relationships is really important.”

While Eshelman has kept the band’s legacy going with anniversary concerts, in the past he hasn’t spent time revising the orchestra’s book. For the Yoshi’s show, he’s not only created some new material, he’s taken his pen to some of the ensemble’s signature works. “I’m looking back and thinking this can be really good,” Eshelman says. Though he officially retired a decade ago, he can’t seem to stay out of the classroom. For the past several years, he’s been leading the Jazzschool’s award-winning Studio Band, which performs on a double bill with the Garden City Jazz Band Dec. 3 at Freight & Salvage.

Details: 8 p.m.Oct. 15; Yoshi’s, Oakland; $19; 510-238-9200, www.yoshis.com.

	West Bay Opera’s ‘La bohème’ finds a modern setting in San Francisco

		
	John Orr
	  
	October 12, 2018 at 6:34 am

					José Luis Moscovich, general director of West Bay Opera.
				

“La bohème,” the popular opera by Giacomo Puccini, is a tale of poor bohemians in 1830s Paris.
“It was during the reign of Louis Philippe, a time of great excess and great income equality, worse than before the French revolution,” said West Bay Opera’s José Luis Moscovich during a recent interview. “The poor had gotten much poorer, the middle class was really strapped, and the rich were living extravagantly.
“In 1830, Paris had yet to see the improvements that were to come in the 1870s,” Moscovich said. “It was still a medieval labyrinth. There was a piling up of people in rental spaces. They were very poor, there was poor sanitation. Artists were constantly being pushed out, unable to get a footing in the cultural capital of Europe.”


When Moscovich wanted to find a more modern setting for the opera, he found a perfect place: today’s San Francisco.
“The parallels are striking,” Moscovich said. “Here we are in San Francisco, people are being pushed around, people are living in tent cities, not just in San Francisco, but also in Palo Alto (where West Bay Opera is based). There are people who aren’t able to afford basic food and services, in the wealthiest region in the world, because of Silicon Valley.”
According to San Francisco’s biannual census, there are more than 7,000 homeless people in San Francisco, and there are many thousands of homeless, including people living in cars and recreational vehicles, all over the Bay Area.
Including on Lambert Street in Palo Alto, near the West Bay Opera building.
“La bohème” is about Mimi, a starving embroiderer, and Rodolfo, a writer who has been forced to burn his manuscript to stay warm. They fall in love, but their story takes tragic turns.
“It has a universal theme,  it’s a love story,” said Moscovich, “but the backdrop is very relevant. It’s good to relate to the story in more than one way. It isn’t just a love story.”
Placing the tale in San Francisco will certainly help the audience recognize the opera’s powerful social themes.
West Bay Opera is renowned for its creative, powerful visuals in its sets, and the stagings for “La bohème” are meant to clearly evoke San Francisco.
For the first act, instead of the 1830s Paris garret, there will be an attic in a Castro District Victorian house. It will have views of Twin Peaks and the Sutro Tower.
Act II takes viewers to North Beach, “a place that has a long history of catering to sailors, when it was a harbor,” said Moscovich. “The Carol Doda strip show is gone now, but the neon signs are still there. It’s where they (Rodolfo and Mimi) go on Christmas Eve. The café has the same name as in the (original) opera — Cafe Momus.”
Act III visits another well-known San Francisco spot. “In the original, you have the entry point to Paris, a customs office,” said Moscovich. “We don’t have that here, so we’re going to use Civic Center Plaza — City Hall with the big dome — with people queuing up to be scanned for metal before going into City Hall. It’s a place with a bunch of homeless people. We’ll see the misery of starting the day in San Francisco in the cold and fog.”
Act IV returns to the attic for Mimi’s tragic end.
Moscovich will again be conducting an orchestra that is too large for the pit at the Lucie Stern Theatre, so will split the musicians between the pit and the stage.
“The amount of sound and the balance is so much better,” said Moscovich. “That means, because of the sight lines, we are more constrained on stage in terms of movement. We compensate for the reduction in available stage by adding more levels. The café is in three different levels, the  garret is in two levels.”
The show will also use projections, a technique West Bay Opera has used to great effect in the past.
“Our two principals, Mimi and Rodolfo, are just fantastic,” said Moscovich. “There is amazing chemistry between them. Julie Adams (an Adler Fellow, and winner of the 2014 Met Auditions) is a fantastic Mimi. Nathan Granner is a match for her as Rodolfo.”
The opera will be sung in Italian, with English supertitles. There will be four performances, over two weekends.

	Do A’s have secret bullpen weapon vs. Yankees in AL Wild Card game?

It’s been almost four years to the day since Yusmeiro Petit played a huge role in keeping the Giants postseason alive. Can he do the same for the A’s on Wednesday night?
It’s anyone’s guess as to how or even if A’s manager Bob Melvin will use Petit in the American League Wild Card game at Yankee Stadium. But there’s plenty of evidence to suggest Petit would be up to any challenge.
As Melvin plots his bullpen usage after opener Liam Hendriks, Petit becomes an attractive option based on how he’s fared against the Yankees. Consider, if Hendriks retires the Yankees in order in the first inning, the remaining six hitters are a combined 0-for-25 with nine strikeouts against Petit in their careers.



The only Yankee with any success against Petit has been leadoff hitter Andrew McCutchen (6-for-14 with a 1.256 OPS). Small sample sizes be damned, the eight other New York hitters are 0-for-29 against the crafty right-hander.
The Yankees who struggle the most against Petit would likely be batting in the second inning, from cleanup hitter Giancarlo Stanton (0-for-10, 4 strikeouts) to No. 6 hitter Didi Gregorius (0-for-6).
Of the 10 teams the rubber-armed Petit faced four or more times this season, only one team hasn’t scored off of him — the Yankees. Petit has been touched for just three hits in 4 2/3 innings against New York this season, including 3 1/3 scoreless innings in two games at Yankee Stadium.
Not only has Petit pitched remarkably well against those in the Yankees starting lineup Wednesday, but he’s obviously got even better history on his side.
Giants fans won’t soon forget how Petit stepped up on Oct. 4, 2014 in the longest postseason game in major league history. He came out of the bullpen to throw six dominant shutout innings to get the win in San Francisco’s epic 2-1, 18-inning victory over the Nationals in the 2014 National League Division Series. The victory went a long way to helping push the Giants to their third World Series title, and Petit was a factor as he threw 12 straight scoreless innings while finishing with a 1.42 postseason ERA.
In his first season with the A’s, Petit has proven to be a steady force in the bullpen with a 3.00 ERA and a 1.01 WHIP in 93 innings over 74 games. Will that plus his success against the Yankees be enough to get him into the game?

The prevailing theory is the A’s will unleash their bevy of power right-handers from the bullpen to combat the Yankees, but the numbers may suggest there’s room to call on a deceptive pitcher who tops out at around 90 mph.
Bruce Bochy and the Giants found that calling on Petit in crucial situations in 2014 seemed to work out pretty well.

	Cal loses in the desert, remains winless in Pac-12

					Cal Bears head coach Justin Wilcox.
				

Quarterback Brandon McIlwain made his first start for Cal on Saturday night at Arizona and played superbly until coming apart at the seams in the desert night.
McIlwain and a stout performance by the Cal defense forged a 14-10 lead, but four second-half turnovers by the sophomore transfer from South Carolina allowed the Wildcats to claim a 24-17 victory.
“You can’t turn the ball over that any times and expect to win,” Cal coach Justin Wilcox said. “A really poor performance on our part, coaching and playing.”


The loss was the 14th in a row in a Pac-12 road game for the Bears (3-2, 0-2), who have not won a conference game outside Berkeley since September 2015. Cal lost to Arizona (3-3, 2-1) for the fourth straight time.
Things seemed in order for the Bears until a poor throw by McIlwain turned into a crazy play that changed everything. He had completed 20 of 25 passes at that point and finished the game with a career-high 315 yards passing and 107 more on the ground, including second-quarter touchdown dashes of 25 and 23 yards.
But late in the third quarter, with Cal leading 14-10, McIlwain overthrew target Kanawai Nai and linebacker Colin Schooler intercepted. Schooler ran 39 yards before Cal wideout Jeremiah Hawkins, coming from behind, punched the ball loose.
It bounced directly into the arms of cornerback Azizi Heard, who ran the final 34 yards into the end zone for the touchdown with 3:19 left in the third quarter for a 17-10 Arizona lead.
Wilcox refused to the blame the loss on strange bounces by the football.
“We didn’t deserve to win the game because of the execution in all phases,” he said. “We can play better. That’s the expectation. We go out and improve. It wasn’t an acceptable performance by us.”
What now at quarterback?
McIlwain had a hand in 422 of Cal’s 476 total yards. But he threw three interceptions and lost a fumble, two of those giveaways leading directly to Arizona touchdowns.
“It’s on me,” McIlwain said of the turnovers. “I’ve got to be able to make better throws, I’ve got to take care of the ball better, make better decisions and clean it up. It’s never acceptable.”
As good as he’s been at times, McIlwain has seven turnovers the past two games, and the other team took four of them back for scores.
Chase Garbers, who started the three previous games and shared snaps with McIlwain, was on the field for just one play at Arizona — when McIlwain lost his helmet and was required to sit out a play.
Wilcox made no dramatic declarations about the future of the position immediately after the game, but wasn’t happy.
“Brandon will get better, no doubt about it,” Wilcox said. “It’s decision-making. Knowing when and where to throw the ball and where not to.”
The fourth-down decision
Down 17-14 with just over 12 minutes left, Wilcox made the call to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the Arizona 3-yard line. McIlwain was stopped cold.
“Trying to win the game. We’re talking about fourth and one yard,” Wilcox said. “When you don’t get the fourth-down conversion, it’s a bad call. And I own it.”
The defense deserved better
Arizona led 10-0 after first quarter, totaling 116 yards in the opening 15 minutes. The Cats’ offense was scoreless the rest of the way. They managed just 149 yards and seven first downs over the final three quarters, averaging 3.5 yards per snap.
Penalties were ugly
The Bears were flagged 13 times for 115 yards in penalties, and everyone contributed. Each of the five starting offensive linemen had at least one infraction, including six false starts.
“We’ve got to be able to focus and execute,” Wilcox said. “We’re going to play in hostile environments. It’s no excuse.”
Next up
UCLA, 0-5 for the first time since 1943, comes to Berkeley next Saturday and Wilcox said the Bears must first deal with the Arizona defeat.
“Own it and eat it,” he said. “The feeling kills you … nobody wants to put all the time and energy we do into this and not have success.”

SAN JOSE – New coach, same heartbreaking results. 

Playing for the first time since Mikael Stahre was fired on Monday, the San Jose Earthquakes blew a two-goal second-half lead and lost 4-3 to Atlanta United Wednesday night at Avaya Stadium. 

 
In a matchup of the best and worst teams in MLS, the Quakes (4-17-8) put up a strong effort under interim coach Steve Ralston but were undone by the usual defensive breakdowns, plus a pivotal video replay call that went against them. 

Josef Martinez scored the winner in the fifth minute of stoppage time, increasing his MLS single-season record to 30 goals for Atlanta (18-5-6). 

“I’m proud of the group and I feel really bad for them because they gave everything tonight,” said Ralston, who made his debut as a head coach. “And to not at least get a point out of this game is really hard for them.” 

Chris Wondolowski appeared to give the Earthquakes a 4-1 lead in the 67th minute, but the goal was reversed by video replay. Instead, Atlanta was awarded a penalty kick for a hand ball in the box by Magnus Eriksson that occurred at the start of the Quakes’ possession. 

Martinez scored the ensuing penalty kick, and Miguel Almiron tied the game three minutes later. 

“Being on the Quakes for this long, I’ve seen this happen to us too many times,” Wondolowski said. “To be honest, felt a little cheated by the refs. We’ve had this referee (Fotis Bazakos) before. He’s had pivotal calls that have gone against us a few times.” 

Ralston made some lineup changes in his first game in charge. Alamo native JT Marcinkowski, 21, made his MLS debut and made four saves. Andrew Tarbell had played every minute this season under Stahre. 

					
				

“I felt like (JT) deserved a chance,” Ralston said. “He’s been training really well. And also I felt like Andrew could use a night off.” 

Midfielder Jackson Yeuill, 21, also entered the lineup in place of Florian Jungwirth. And with Wondolowski being used as a second-half sub, Georgian fullback Guram Kashia, who was acquired on June 14, wore the captain’s armband for the first time. 

The team seemed energized early. Nick Lima headed in a cross from Shea Salinas, and then Danny Hoesen collected his own rebound and chipped in a shot over goalie Brad Guzan to put the Quakes up 2-0. 

Atlanta got a goal back in first-half injury time, but Vako Qazaishvili made it 3-1 with one of the highlights of the season, dribbling through three defenders in the box before shooting into the side netting. 

But blown leads have been a constant issue for the Quakes at Avaya Stadium, and Wednesday wouldn’t be any different, especially when facing the highest-scoring team in the league. 

“It’s been a tumultuous week, but at the same time we have to do better,” Wondolowski said. “We had a lead that we gave up. It’s not good enough.” 

The Quakes next visit LAFC, the third-best team in the Western Conference, on Saturday. 

“We showed we can play with the best teams,” Ralston said. “We just have to do it consistently.”

						Mr. Roadshow urges drivers to relax and not push others to speed up. (Kristopher Skinner/Bay Area News Group file)		
	
By Gary Richards | grichards@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: July 25, 2018 at 4:00 am | UPDATED: July 25, 2018 at 10:55 am


Q: It is funny how Road Boulders love to jump all over speeders when they, too, are not paying attention to the rules of the road. There are signs that say “Slow Traffic Keep Right,” but they can ignore that, right?

I find myself getting more angry that I am stuck with someone who thinks they are my parent or policing everyone on the road. If I choose to go a few miles an hour over the speed limit, that is my choice. Yet we speeders are always the bad guys. Road Boulders constantly cause an accordion-type backup. Why being a Road Boulder is a better idea is beyond me.

When I speed, it happens when I am so frustrated that I cannot pass four lanes of Road Boulders blocking me. I have to wait for someone to go a mile or two faster than the other 3 lanes and allow someone to pass. It is beyond aggravating, and I have no way around unless I break another law and use the diamond lane when I am a solo driver.


Like Mr. Roadshow’s Facebook page for more questions and answers about Bay Area roads, freeways and commuting. 


Maybe these people should be courteous, and they would no longer find themselves being passed at 90 mph because someone is so mad they have been stuck 10 minutes behind them unnecessarily. Think about the safety of others and stop trying to control everyone else.

Erinn Lindstrom

Antioch

A: Whoa. Relax and go with the flow, everyone. If four lanes are going the same speed, don’t push get them to go faster. And don’t jump in the carpool lane.

Q: A question for bike commuters on BART: Why do so many seem to have difficulty understanding the “Bikes are never allowed on the first car of any train” rule? I hear that announcement at least every other day while we then wait for the person to move to another car. There can’t be that many new riders every day. Do they think the train operator won’t notice?

At the North Berkeley station, a Fremont train had to sit almost a minute while the train operator five to six times announced that bikes were not allowed in the lead car and that the passenger with the bike needed to move.

	Herhold: Ro Khanna is a vote for the future

If you’re thinking about whether to vote for Ro Khanna for Congress, pay heed to something that happened when he was 14 years old.
His 9th grade teacher in suburban Philadelphia, Mrs. Raab, challenged her students to get something published in the local newspaper, the Bucks County Courier Times.

			Honda ad against Khanna evokes prejudice		

			
	

	


			
	
				
			Political hits come early for absentee voters		

			
	


Building on a school essay, Khanna wrote an opinion piece that critiqued President George H.W. Bush’s likely invasion of Iraq.  The newspaper ran it under the title: “Read this 14-year-old’s lips, George.’’


His theme, at bottom, was peace.  “Every soldier’s life has a priceless monetary value,’’ the young Khanna wrote.  “We must have no doubts before engaging in war.’’
Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine got it right.  If you want to know what makes a politician tick, pay attention to the things that engaged him or her before politics.
When you look hard at the young Khanna, you see ambition — yes — but also a concern for peace, a precocious command of language, and a belief that government can shape lives for the better.
In the last few weeks, we’ve seen an ugly back-and-forth in the race for the 17th congressional district between Khanna, the 40-year-old challenger, and Mike Honda, the 75-year-old incumbent.
You might think the race turned on how many Honda email addresses Khanna’s ex-campaign manager culled from a former consultancy, or how many naps the incumbent took during important meetings.
We should all understand those issues are sidelights, red flags waved in the political bull ring. The fundamental issue here is much simpler, much starker. It’s whether you vote for the future — Khanna — or the past — Honda.
To anyone who thinks that’s an indictment of age, let me hasten to add that my verdict is much more than a chronological tally.  It’s a question of the freshness of ideas, the promise of change.
When you talk to long-time Democrats who back Honda, one of the most common complaints about Khanna is that he hasn’t paid his dues. He hasn’t served on a city council or a school board.
But history suggests there is more than one way to prepare for Congress. And there is no better example than U.S. Rep. Don Edwards, a title company executive who was elected in 1962 to represent some of the same turf now covered by the 17th.
Edwards, then 47, arguably had less convincing credentials to join Congress than Khanna does now. He had never held elective office. For most of his life, he was a Republican. He was known as a superb golfer and an ex-FBI agent.
If the critique that Honda backers deploy now against Khanna had succeeded  in 1962, we would have been deprived of one of America’s greatest champions of civil rights and human liberty.
(For the record, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a darling of many of the liberals who support Honda, had never been elected to office before. Neither had Nancy Pelosi or John F. Kennedy.)
By this I don’t mean that Khanna lacks credentials:  He’s Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago; a graduate of Yale Law School, an ex-undersecretary in the Obama Commerce Department, author of a well-written book on manufacturing, lecturer at Stanford, and the loser of two previous campaigns for the House  (and yes, failure is a great teacher.)
My larger point is this: Anyone who has ever hired well can tell you that while credentials matter, promise and aptitude matter just as much, maybe more.
Mike Honda has covered himself in dishonor this fall, as he did in the House ethics investigation that found evidence that he confused the workings of his office with favors for his campaign. A racially-tinged ad that had an Indian actor playing a smarmy Khanna went over the line.
The real reason to make a change in the 17th District, however, isn’t just dissatisfaction with a genial eight-term incumbent who has lost his way.
In Ro Khanna, the voters have a chance to send a young and energetic man with demonstrable intellectual firepower to an institution that badly needs change.
You don’t need to agree with everything Khanna says to know that a vote for him is a commitment to the future, not the past. In Silicon Valley, that choice isn’t just easy. It’s critical.

USC quarterback Sam Darnold isn’t out of the Heisman Trophy race, not yet, not completely. There are too many showcase games left and too many potential pitfalls for the current favorites.



If Darnold played for all but a handful of others team, he’d be done and gone.

But the starting quarterback for USC is one of the sport’s glamour positions, carrying enormous prestige nationally, particularly with the older portion of the Heisman electorate.

Darnold can make up ground on the Heisman leaders in a heartbeat, so long as he plays well on the biggest stages.

No stage is grander than Notre Dame Stadium, where echoes ring, thunder shakes and Stiffarms are won.

Of the Heisman’s six voting regions, five are east of, or border, the Mississippi River.

					
				

South Bend is smack in the middle of those five.

The latest installment of one of the game’s greatest rivalries — the Irish and Trojans have combined for 14 Heisman winners — will match one loss teams with designs on the playoff at 7:30 p.m. (ET) on broadcast television (NBC).

Exposure is not an issue.

Darnold opened the season as the Heisman frontrunner and is currently No. 7 on Bovada’s list of betting favorites, behind Penn State’s Saquon Barkley, Stanford’s Bryce Love and Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield.

His positioning, while hardly ideal, is not unprecedented. Other recent Heisman winners have hovered on the second tier in October.

If Darnold leads the Trojans to victory Saturday with a sterling performance, he’ll vault back into the lead pack.

But history says this is his last stand. Dominance against Notre Dame goes arm-in-arm with USC’s Heisman success.

Mike Garrett and O.J. Simpson were limited in their effectiveness — legendary sportswriter Dan Jenkins wrote about the latter for Sports Illustrated, a piece titled ‘The Day They Tied Up O.J.’ — but starting with Charles White, there is an uninterrupted line of dominance:

White ’79: Rushed for a career-high 261 yards and scored four touchdowns in a 42-23 victory.

Marcus Allen ’81: Rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown in a 14-7 victory.

Carson Palmer ’02: Completed 32-of-46 passes for 425 yards and four touchdowns in a 44-13 win.

Matt Leinart ’04: Completed 24-of-34 passes for 400 yards and five touchdowns in a 41-10 victory.

Reggie Bush ’05: Rushed for 160 yards and three touchdowns on runs of 36 and 45 yards (plus a push).

Five first-class performance, five USC wins and five Heismans.

If Darnold rekindles the Palmer-Leinart magic, he’ll have taken a major first step to making it six.

By Jon Wilner | jwilner@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: August 14, 2018 at 10:44 pm | UPDATED: August 20, 2018 at 4:33 pm


The Hotline podcast returns this week following a summer hiatus, with a slew of guests in the pipeline.

We’ll address players and teams and also some big-picture issues affecting not only the Pac-12 but college football in general, from media rights to head trauma research, from the legalization of gambling to the legal challenges facing the NCAA.



My first guest of the 2018-19 cycle is Phil Steele, owner and author of the best preview magazine in the history of the sport.

The preview guru to preview the season, if you will.

Steele’s magazine is 300-something pages of information smashed together in a fashion only a junkie could love.

I asked Steele about the production of the magazine, his conversations with the head coaches and whether those post-spring chats changed his presumptions about any team in the Pac-12.

He mentioned one: Oregon.

“I came into the conversation (with Mario Cristobal) down on Oregon because of their pitiful bowl performance,” Steele recalled. “But I came out thinking we’ve got ourselves a sleeper in the Pac-12 North.”

					
				

We also addressed:

* Washington’s showdown with Auburn.

“That’s a massive game for the Pac-12,” Steele said before outlining a scenario in which a loss by the Huskies could doom the conference in the playoff race.

* The Herm Edwards experiment:

“It will be interesting to see how it works out. Everybody has got the popcorn in hand.”

* Kevin Sumlin’s arrival in Tucson:

Steele recalled what Sumlin said during a recent conversation about the searing pressure in the SEC: “You knew the guy you were shaking hands with, that one of the two of you probably wouldn’t be back the next year.”

“I think he’s a great fit for Arizona,” he added.

* The challenges facing Chip Kelly in Year One at UCLA:

“They have talent,” Steele noted. “When I talked to Mora last year, we were talking about the offensive line and he says, ‘Well, watch our defensive line, these guys are great.’ …

“There’s no way a coach is that high on talent on hand if they’re not that good.

“I just think with the drastic changes in schemes, losing a guy like Josh Rosen … playing the toughest schedule.”

* How the Pac-12 could repair its reputation:

“Making the playoffs is not the big thing. How you fare in non-conference play is the big thing; how you fare in the bowls is the big thing.”

			It wasn't that long ago, actually. Thoughts of a winless season began dancing after the awful home loss to Fresno State in Week Three, then gained steam after the second-half collapse at Colorado in Week Five. The dread was partly rooted in reality, what with the rugged schedule and the self-destructive tendencies and the personnel flaws and the rookie quarterback...

As he tries to make history as the first independent candidate elected to California statewide office, former insurance commissioner Steve Poizner is saying mea culpa for his past Trump-like stances.

Eight years ago, during his unsuccessful run for governor as a Republican, Poizner bemoaned the influence of undocumented immigrants and vowed to block them from receiving “taxpayer-funded benefits.”

He supported ending in-state college tuition for undocumented students, called for the California National Guard to deploy to the Mexican border, and endorsed a controversial Arizona law that allowed police to detain people they thought were undocumented. He even argued that public schools should refuse to enroll undocumented children.

Now, as he’s running for his old insurance commissioner job as an independent, Poizner insists he no longer supports those ideas.

“I regret the tone and direction that we took in that campaign,” he said in an interview with the Bay Area News Group editorial board this week, calling his approach in that race “wrong and harmful.”

Poizner says he now believes everyone who’s undocumented should be “put on a path to get documented,” and young people on the DACA program should be eligible for U.S. citizenship. He took his previous anti-immigrant positions while under “huge pressure” in a competitive primary race against former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, Poizner said.

“It really felt like a foxhole,” he said. “I will never ever, ever again run a campaign that has a divisive tone.”

But his Democratic opponents in the insurance commissioner race point to Poizner’s history of immigrant-bashing as a sign that his new independent branding is little more than political opportunism.

					
				

State Sen. Ricardo Lara, the son of formerly undocumented immigrants from Mexico, called Poizner’s decision to run as an independent “disingenuous,” and said he planned to educate voters about Poizner’s past statements on immigrants.

“You don’t forget those remarks about families like mine,” Lara, D-Bell Gardens, said in an interview. “You can apologize, but you can never take back the words that harm so many people.”

Poizner, a wealthy former Silicon Valley tech executive, was considered a political moderate before veering to the right during his bid for governor.

He says he now wants to be a pioneer for non-partisan politicians at a time when more and more Californians are declining to pick a party. More than 4.7 million voters — one in four — chose no party preference, according to the most recent data from January, nearly as many as those registered as Republican.

There is no Republican candidate in the race for the obscure insurance commissioner job. Also running is Democrat Asif Mahmood, a Los Angeles doctor. Incumbent commissioner Dave Jones, a Democrat, is running for Attorney General.

Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist who unsuccessfully ran for Secretary of State as an independent in 2014, said Poizner had a good chance of being the first person to win statewide office in California without a party affiliation.

“Steve has the benefit of having held statewide office in the past, as well as access to significant financial resources,” Schnur said. “He’s in a very strong position, much stronger than I was in my race.”

Still, there are some major structural hurdles for independent candidates. Under California law, they have “NPP” — no party preference — next to their name on the ballot, instead of “independent,” potentially confusing many voters.

Poizner, who voted for libertarian Gary Johnson for president in 2016, changed his voting registration to no party preference in January. He declined to say whether he had decided to run as an independent before or after doing polling about what that would mean for his candidacy.

Along with former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Poizner is the last person elected to California statewide office as a Republican. His decision to jump ship from the GOP this year could be bad news for the party’s leaders, who are trying to break Democrats’ stronghold on major elected offices.

“If he were to succeed, or at least get close, it would provide a roadmap for Republicans to political relevance as independents,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University. Other prominent candidates might follow his lead.

State GOP chair Jim Brulte did not respond to a request for comment.

Poizner plans to spend some of his own fortune on the race while also taking donations, although none from insurance companies.

If elected, he says he’d focus on beefing up efforts to combat insurance fraud, improving forest maintenance to reduce costly wildfires, and enforcing regulations on homeowner insurance.

“It’d be great if the insurance commissioner was truly independent of all partisan politics,” Poizner said. “If you want to be a partisan warrior, there’s plenty of places for that.”

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

			Milbank: Why steel tariffs just get dumb and dumber		

	
	

The radical shrinking of the steel labor force has continued despite the various attempts to restrict imports: voluntary agreements in the 1980s, duties in the 1990s, more tariffs in 2002. None have been effective, because imports aren’t the problem.

In a controversial move that has angered European Union leaders, President Donald Trump has announced a plan to place tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The European Union head president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has said he will put tariffs on products like Harley-Davidsons, Kentucky bourbon and bluejeans if the steel tariffs go through.

By Washington Post Columnist Milbank | 
PUBLISHED: March 12, 2018 at 12:15 pm | UPDATED: March 12, 2018 at 12:23 pm


WASHINGTON — The steel industry, shedding workers, shutting plants and bleeding red ink, pleaded with the federal government for tariffs on imports. As the government obliged, a young reporter on the steel beat for the Wall Street Journal cautioned that tariffs could “ultimately do the industry more harm than good” because the real threat to big steel wasn’t foreign competition but changing technology.

That was 1992. The administration that imposed the trade barriers was George H.W. Bush’s. And the young steel reporter was me.

Twenty-six years later, what’s old is new again. The industry’s fortunes have waxed and waned with the economy and the price of steel. Trade protections came and went. But steel jobs continue to vanish. That’s because the job loss has almost nothing to do with imports.

President Trump, playing the charlatan, is telling steelworkers he’ll protect their jobs with his 25 percent tariff, made official Thursday, on all imports but those from Canada and Mexico. “We’re going to have a lot of great jobs … coming back into our country,” Trump promised.

Then he yielded the lectern to Scott Sauritch, a local union president from Pennsylvania who said his father, Herman Sauritch, had been a steelworker, but “during the ’80s, he lost his job due to imports coming into this country.”

“Well,” replied Trump, “your father, Herman, is looking down. He’s very proud of you right now.”

“Oh, he’s still alive,” Scott Sauritch corrected.

Not only did Trump kill off poor Herman Sauritch, but he’s also dooming the dreams of another generation of steelworkers. The elder Sauritch probably didn’t lose his job because of foreigners. Nor do today’s steelworkers.

The United States has been a net importer of steel for six decades. It imported more than 20 percent of steel through much of the 1980s, and imports of finished steel today remain in that ballpark, about 25 percent of the market. Imports in 2017, $29.1 billion, were nearly identical to 2011’s $30.5 billion..

					
				

What has changed is that Americans consume far less steel — little more than half as much per capita compared with in the 1970s — as improved technology means automobiles and other applications require less of it. At the same time, improved steelmaking productivity means the industry requires dramatically less labor. Steel production is down by a third since the 1970s, but employment is down by about three-quarters.

These changes were well underway when I arrived in Pittsburgh in 1990 for my first job after college. At other newspapers, cub reporters might be assigned the cops beat; at the Journal, the joke went, they put you on the copper beat. I was assigned nonferrous metals and worked my way up to steel by way of machine tools and rubber.

There was still enough steel production in the area back then that when I left the windows open in my apartment, a film of black soot coated the sill. I toured the hulking industrial remains of the Monongahela Valley, and I still have over my desk a framed panorama, circa 1910, of mighty Homestead Steel Works, its furnaces blackening the sky. I visited steelworkers’ bars and wrote about the plight of a lost generation of industrial workers.

I also wrote about what was displacing them: “Minimills,” with their electric-arc furnaces that melted scrap steel, used only a third as many workers to produce a ton of steel as the old “integrated” producers, with their iron ore and coke blast furnaces.

“Big steelmakers everywhere are finding that the economies of scale that helped them prevail since Andrew Carnegie’s day no longer favor them,” I wrote in February 1993, noting that some expected Nucor, the leading minimill, to replace U.S. Steel as the nation’s largest producer by the year 2000.

Nucor did become the largest U.S. steelmaker, and the entire industry has become less labor-intensive. The Associated Press reported this week that U.S. steel producers require only 1.5 person-hours to make a ton of steel, down from more than 10 in the 1980s. Electric furnaces make about 70 percent of this country’s steel, up from less than 30 percent when I covered the industry.

As a result, the radical shrinking of the steel labor force has continued despite the various attempts to restrict imports: voluntary agreements in the 1980s, duties in the 1990s, more tariffs in 2002. None was effective, because imports weren’t the problem.

The better answer, all along, has been for government to help steelworkers (and coal miners and other industrial workers who face a similar situation) to retrain and otherwise adapt to the inevitable.

LOS ANGELES — Porn star Yurizan Beltran’s death late last year was primarily caused by “hydrocodone toxicity,” and her death has been listed as accidental, the coroner’s office reported today.

The 31-year-old woman, whose full name was Yurizan Beltran Renteria, died at a residence in Los Angeles County on Dec. 13, according to the coroner’s office.

			By spending more time on the aftermath than on the crime itself, the filmmaker loses some of the urgency of his other movies.

By Amy Dickinson | Tribune Content Agency
PUBLISHED: September 21, 2018 at 6:00 am | UPDATED: September 21, 2018 at 6:05 am


Columnist Amy Dickinson (Bill Hogan/Chicago Tribune) 
DEAR AMY: My fiance and I have started planning our wedding. I have four brothers; my fiance has two brothers. Both of his brothers are married. I am not necessarily close with their wives, but I was a bridesmaid in their weddings, although I was placed last on the line (farthest away from bride and groom) in both cases.

Should I choose to include these women as my bridesmaids, and ask my fiance to include my four brothers as his groomsmen? We had originally planned to have no wedding party, but I don’t want to hurt any family members’ feelings (mine would have been hurt if I was left out).

 I had also thought to just have my brothers stand with me, and his brothers stand with him. Or have my mother and cousin stand up with me.
My sisters-in-law love me, and I love them. But if I choose to exclude them, am I setting the stage for angst and hurt for years to come? We are paying for this wedding ourselves and trying to keep costs down. I don’t know what to do, and no one around me can offer sound advice without airing their personal feelings.

Too Many Siblings

DEAR TOO MANY: Your own reaction to the honor when you were twice asked to be a bridesmaid — to complain because you were placed “last on the line” — reveals how seriously some people take these wedding honors/duties.

You are overthinking this, and seem torn between serving your own wants (not to have attendants), versus your perceptions of how tenderly people respond to being asked, or excluded, from the wedding party.

Because I don’t think you are capable of handling the complications involved with making actual choices and managing this social burden confidently, I think you and your guy should go it alone, and ask your brothers and their spouses/partners to enjoy being honored guests.

DEAR AMY: I am in an office of about 25 employees, and we each have our own cubicle with dividing partitions above the desk, but not below.

					
				

I sit near a back corner of the office, with one coworker, “Tom,” sitting between me and the restrooms. Tom has a few quirks that drive me crazy; in particular, he snickers loudly every time we can hear anything that goes on in the bathrooms, even going so far as to comment out loud (“oh man!)” occasionally.

We all know what happens in a bathroom, and it’s hard enough to be in a small office where nothing is really private, does he really need to draw attention to it? He also scoots away from his desk and sneezes into the void below his (and my) desk every time he sneezes.

I cringe, thinking about all of the things he’s sneezing on that might make it home with me that night (my purse, my shoes, myself). As I am the only person actually sitting next to him, his comments about the bathroom and his sneezes directly affect me, but others might not even notice.

Is there a way to politely ask him to cover his mouth when he sneezes, and to stop commenting on the bathroom sounds? I feel like I have to teach him how to be an adult, when he’s actually in his 40s.

Grossed Out Co-worker

DEAR GROSSED OUT: Why does Tom get to behave as he pleases, while you worry excessively about being polite?

Use your words: “Hey, Tom, it’s tough enough for us to sit here right next to the bathrooms all day. You commenting out loud about every noise makes things worse. Can you stop doing that?”

Frankly, Tom has a right to sneeze in the space beneath his own desk. The fact that his space is connected with yours is not something he can control. Your shoes being sneezed upon does not seem to place you at risk. You might want to store your handbag in a file drawer, however.

DEAR AMY: “A Concerned Mom” reported that her 10-year-old saw some other kids “vaping” in the locker room. Your answer missed the point: Depending on what state they live in, vaping for under 18-year-olds is illegal!

Upset

DEAR UPSET: I believe you are mistaken. Sales of vaping products to minors are banned in some states, but actual use of these products seems to have slipped through a legal loophole.

But that is immaterial. Children should not be vaping, and this boy’s concerns should be dealt with by the adults in his life.

A federal indictment alleges that a San Mateo couple built up a multimillion-dollar prostitution business out of massage parlors in Kansas and used the money to buy real estate in the Bay Area.

Defendants Weiling and Erik Nielsen, who are married, were indicted last week on charges of money laundering, conspiracy in aid of racketeering, and bank fraud. They were arrested Tuesday in the Bay Area. The charging documents describe conduct going back more than a decade.

Federal prosecutors have filed asset forfeiture petitions to seize money and property believed to be bought with illegally obtained funds.

Weiling and Erik Nielsen were indicted as part of a multiagency investigation into suspected massage parlor prostitution rings throughout Kansas. Federal prosecutors in Topeka secured three separate grand jury indictments charging five defendants for their alleged roles in maintaining the illicit parlors and laundering money.

According to the indictment, Weiling and Erik Nielsen represented themselves as restaurant owners in Lawrence, Kansas, but operated two prostitution businesses — Naima Asian Massage and Serenity Health Spa — in that city.

“These businesses operated on a mostly cash basis,” federal prosecutors wrote in the indictment.

	Warriors Profiles: Could Jordan Bell play his way out of the Bay Area?

		
	Logan Murdock
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 8, 2018 at 2:18 pm | UPDATED: October 9, 2018 at 2:57 am

	  
		Categories:
		Golden State Warriors, Latest Headlines, Sports	



	
					


					Golden State Warriors' Jordan Bell (2) is photographed during the Golden State Warriors Media Day at Rakuten Performance Center in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, Sept. 24, 2018. (Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group)
				


Will this Warriors’ big man find consistency after a rollercoaster rookie year? Find out below in our latest preseason profile.
(In case you missed them previously, here are the first installations of our ‘Game Faces’ feature, profiles on Jacob Evans, Jonas Jerebko, Quinn Cook, Damian Jones and Kevon Looney. Dope images provided by Jose Carlos Fajardo)
Jordan Bell
Contract: 1 year / $1,378,242 (Warriors can extend a $1.8 million qualifying offer this summer)


Outlook: Jordan Bell’s rookie season started as well as he could’ve hoped. He started his career making 26 of his first 37 shots, while starting in 13 games. Over a 15-game stretch in December, he averaged 7.7 points and 5.3 rebounds on 65.4 percent from the field.
Bell’s physical attributes, combined with athletic timing, made him the perfect rim protector alongside the Warriors’ all-star cast. In an early season win over the Bulls, Bell blocked six shots in 26 minutes. His ability to guard multiple positions allowed the Warriors to play small, helping them get out and run.
(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) However, following an ankle injury, Bell struggled to find a rhythm as his inflamed joint continued to bother him and his effort was starting to lag. In the last month of the season, he averaged just 11.7 minutes per game, down from 14.2.
This season Bell hopes to stay consistent while showing his expanded game. Over the summer, he worked on a myriad of jump shots and baby hooks to complement the Warriors offense. On defense, he guarded players with his hands behind his back to discourage reaching.
(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) Bell, a longtime lover of sweets, cut out junk food for the entire month of August in an effort to enter training camp in prime condition. Even when old bad habits began to creep up, former Lakers’ star Kobe Bryant was there to provide words of wisdom.
With the Warriors playing a “center by committee” scheme, Bell’s skills will be needed against athletic teams who like to run. And, as history suggests, Bell should be ready for the challenge.
Another factor to Bell’s second season is his contract. He’s slated to be a restricted free agent this summer and if he plays near his peak, it could be hard for the Warriors to keep him with Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant up for new contracts. Those close to Bell say he wants to be in Golden State for as long as possible, but if Bell’s game is up to par, he just might play his way out of town.
Final verdict: Bell’s athleticism and speed are going to be hard to miss this season, but can the second year player be consistent an entire season?

	Gassy cows are bad for the planet; could seaweed diet help?

		
	Associated Press
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 30, 2018 at 8:41 am | UPDATED: October 1, 2018 at 4:24 am

					In this Sept. 27, 2018, photo provided by Green Grazing, Australis Aquaculture employee Khanh Huynh checks on seaweed cultures, near Ninh Hai, Vietnam, Australis’s “Greener Grazing” project seeks to make a kind of seaweed that helps reduce methane emissions in livestock available to more farmers. (Josh Goldman/Green Grazing via AP)

				

By PATRICK WHITTLE
A New England-based aquaculture company is launching a drive to become the worldwide leader in an emerging effort to thwart climate change by feeding seaweed to cows.
The concept of reducing livestock emissions by using seaweed as feed is the subject of ongoing scientific research.


University of California researchers have found that cows that eat seaweed appear to emit less methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.
One of the challenges of implementing the seaweed solution is getting enough of the stuff to farmers. One kind of seaweed that has shown results in cows isn’t commercially farmed.
Australis Aquaculture of Greenfield, Massachusetts, is in the midst of research at facilities in Vietnam and Portugal that is part of its push to become the first farm to produce the seaweed at commercial scale.

						Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and many others are paving a path to justice by creating the space for at least one survivor to speak her truth. (Rich Pedroncelli?Associated Press Photo)		
	
By Ruth Ferguson | 
PUBLISHED: October 9, 2018 at 4:15 pm | UPDATED: October 10, 2018 at 3:38 pm


“To the men in this country: just shut up and step up. Do the right thing.”

Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono’s comment, in regard to Christine Blasey Ford’s credible accusation of sexual assault by recently appointed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, served as a powerful example of courage and frustration by an elected official. She continued, “We have to create an environment where women can come forward and be heard and be listened to.” Her message was to believe and trust women.

All over the country, women and men are coming forward with painful #MeToo stories that call into question the integrity of some of our most powerful members of society. Women in power like Sens. Hirono, Kamala Harris, and many others are paving a path to justice by creating the space for at least one survivor to speak her truth.

Someone recently asked me why female candidates running for political office are leaning into their identities as women. He didn’t understand why female candidates thought it was necessary to unabashedly flaunt their gender. “It’s a shame,” he said, “Why should I be more inclined to elect a woman over someone else with similar experience?”

It was difficult for me to even understand his questions at first because it seemed so obvious. In Congress, only 20 percent of women hold office. At a local level, 30 percent of the San Jose City Council and 20 percent of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors are women. On top of that, women in this area earn 67.9 percent of what men are paid in full-time, year-round jobs. Women constitute close to 51 percent of the population in the United States, yet they are underrepresented at almost every level of government.

Electing women is not about overpowering men or advancing a purely female agenda. Electing women is about equity and representation for everyone. It’s about electing women of color, trans women, and above all else, supporting an overwhelming section of our society that has been marginalized for centuries. It’s about empowering women like Blasey Ford and the scores of #MeToo accusers who have come before her to speak their truth. Electing women is a moral issue.
Of course, it’s true that we need qualified and experienced elected officials. Not every woman is prepared to hold elected office, nor is every man. But, fortunately, a record number of highly qualified women are running for elected office in 2018. In Santa Clara County alone, 120 women are running for contested seats.  That means more opportunities to empower and support women in your community.

Do the right thing Nov. 6. Do your research. Elect qualified, experienced women.

Ruth Ferguson is the deputy campaign manager for Susan Ellenberg for Santa Clara County Supervisor.

By Laurel Rosenhall, CALmatters | CALmatters
PUBLISHED: October 14, 2018 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: October 15, 2018 at 2:57 am



One morning at the end of August, with the capstone of his political career in the balance, state Sen. Kevin de León retreated to his Capitol office and turned on the TV. On the screen, colleagues who had known the Los Angeles Democrat for years debated his landmark bill to eliminate fossil fuels from California’s electrical system. The bill was big, attracting national attention. But it wasn’t going to pass, at least not on this vote, and no smart politician sets himself up for a public loss.

Former California Assembly Speaker Kevin De Leon, and candidate for the U.S. Senate, meets with the editorial board of the Bay Area News Group in San Jose, Calif., Monday, April 16, 2018. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) 
So here he was, hunkered down in his half-emptied workspace, when talk of the bill’s merits morphed into a debate about de León himself. First, a Central Valley Democrat accused him of disrespecting rural Californians and pandering to progressive voters. Then, a San Diego Democrat stuck up for de Leon.

“You don’t have to like the author,” Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher pleaded as she asked for votes.

Upstairs in his office, de León didn’t flinch. The bill fell four ayes short of passing, but that temporary setback — it ultimately would become law — resonated less than Gonzalez Fletcher’s revealing admission.

Her acknowledgment encapsulated both the complexity of his legislative career and the factious nature of his campaign to unseat U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Few politicians can match de León’s hard work and political instincts, yet few spend as much time dealing with people, even some political allies, who personally dislike them. The 51-year-old characterizes it as the price of success.

“I’m willing to fight for what I believe in,” de León said, “and willing to fight for what’s right.”

After 12 years in the Legislature, the first Latino in modern history to lead the state Senate is now forced out by term limits. De León leaves a stack of accomplishments: laws he wrote to combat climate change, help workers save for retirement and protect undocumented immigrants.

But he’s also developed a reputation for power tripping and chasing the spotlight. And, though never accused of wrongdoing, de León has been near the center of the Capitol’s most serious ethical crises. He was a witness in the federal corruption case that sent one senator to prison, and was housemates with another who resigned this year under investigation for sexual harassment.

“He’s not everything he says he is,” said Dana Williamson, who worked closely with de León when she was a top aide to Gov. Jerry Brown.

					
				

Perhaps nothing de León has done is more polarizing than his challenge to Feinstein, a 26-year incumbent and Democratic legend. He is attacking her from the left, energizing progressives by framing himself as a more forceful resistance against President Trump.

Polls still show him behind her but gaining headed into the November election when, because of California’s nonpartisan election system, voters will choose between the two Democrats.

Many Democratic legislators have endorsed him. But two of the Capitol’s most powerful figures — Gov. Brown and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon — back Feinstein.

Gonzalez Fletcher, the supporter who jumped in to defend his energy bill, says de León “bears the weight of being a very active, very progressive, very out-there leader, and that causes some people discomfort.”



Splitting the party is, in some ways, familiar territory for de León. He’s been a disrupter from day one.

De León often tells the story of growing up with a single mother in the San Diego barrio. What he shares more reluctantly is that his mother and father were each married to other people when his mother became pregnant with him. His birth split the families that came before him, he said, and he lived alone with his mother for years before learning he had older sisters from her prior marriage.

“I struggle with that,” de León said. “You kind of feel like you just don’t have a foundation.”

His father was barely part of his life. De León and his mother, an immigrant from Guatemala, strained to get by on what she earned cleaning houses. They rented one room in someone else’s house and, throughout his early years, shared the same bed. When de León was a teenager, they rented two rooms in a basement, each one padlocked to keep out tenants living in the other rooms.

His mother died of cancer when de León was in his 20s. After dropping out of UC Santa Barbara, de León began a job preparing immigrants for citizenship. He had fallen in love with a fellow student and in 1994 they marched with their baby girl in a huge protest against Proposition 187, the ballot measure — later overturned by the courts — to slash services for undocumented immigrants.

The campaign felt like an attack on his family, and fired his ambition. He worked for the teachers union, graduated from college at age 36, and ran for office for the first time in 2006, defeating Christine Chavez — the granddaughter of labor icon Cesar Chavez  — for a seat in the state Assembly.

Activism on behalf of immigrants has been a hallmark of his Capitol career as well. He authored the “sanctuary state” bill that was signed into law last year.

Yet Dolores Huerta — icon of the farmworker movement — supports Feinstein. She recalled de León approaching her at a labor council meeting earlier this year: “He came at me scolding me, saying ‘Why aren’t you supporting me?’ And I said, ‘Kevin, let me count the ways.’” Huerta called de León a “bully” and an “opportunist” for, in her view, dividing Democrats and disrespecting Feinstein.

But some Democrats, even some Feinstein supporters, praise de León for infusing the race with urgency, forcing the incumbent to prove herself to voters.

“Kevin had every right to run. I think he brings an important perspective to the race,” said state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco.

Wiener endorsed Feinstein but said he thinks highly of de León, calling him a “substantive policy person” and “a gentleman.”



 

California collects billions of dollars through its cap-and-trade program that makes companies pay to emit greenhouse gases. Laws written by de León require that a chunk of the funds flow to disadvantaged neighborhoods, to pay for environmental enhancements like planting trees and installing rooftop solar panels.

“He’s got what I think is almost a unique ability to marry climate change concerns, which are normally the province of white coastal elites, to working class people,” said R. L. Miller, chair of the California Democratic Party’s environmental caucus.

But where Miller endorses him as an “inspiring, transformational candidate,” other Democratic activists say de León’s environmental record is inconsistent. They are angered by his 2013 vote against a bill to ban plastic bags, and how he helped block a bill that would have delayed a project to suck water from the Mojave Desert.

After the clean-electricity bill was defeated on the Assembly floor, one of de León’s aides handed him a list of the votes. He pulled out a blue pen and began circling names of lawmakers he believed he could convince to change their minds.

By the end of the night, the bill had passed and de León was slapping backs and shaking hands on the Assembly floor. At week’s end, after he’d cast his final votes as a state lawmaker, de León celebrated in a Capitol hallway, singing along triumphantly to a mariachi serenade.
You didn’t have to like him, as his allies might have said, to admire his hunger, his refusal to be discounted, his willingness to disrupt all sorts of notions about California and its future, if that’s what it takes to make a change.

This is an abridged version of the full story, which is available at CALmatters.org — a nonprofit, nonpartisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.

By Paul Rogers | progers@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: June 29, 2018 at 1:55 pm | UPDATED: June 30, 2018 at 7:34 am


Efforts to restore a stunning mile-long stretch of remote oceanfront property seven miles south of Half Moon Bay that has been marred in recent years by rowdy overnight beach parties and piles of trash received a major boost this week: $5 million in Gov. Jerry Brown’s new state budget.

The money will go a long way to building a parking lot, restrooms and trail at Tunitas Creek Beach, supporters said Friday, creating a new San Mateo County beach park. It would be the first new large sandy public beach park in Northern California in decades.

“This is an incredible opportunity. It’s a spectacular beach,” said Walter Moore, president of the Peninsula Open Space Trust, a Palo Alto environmental group that purchased 58 acres of bluffs and beach there last November to help create the park, which technically is open to the public now.



The beach has a colorful and rowdy history.

Hundreds of people with stereo systems, disco balls, tents, kegs and mattresses have left huge amounts of trash, set off fireworks and used Tunitas Creek Beach as a bathroom during all-night raves. Two years ago, a San Jose man drowned there.

A company known as Todd Gelfand Trust, which is linked to pop singer Chris Isaak, purchased the bluff-top land, a small house and most of the sand on the beach in 1998 for $3.1 million. Isaak was never seen at the property, locals say, and the singer has declined interview requests to discuss why he purchased the land. But when the trust sold it to Moore’s organization last fall, a new course was set.

San Mateo County Supervisor Don Horsley, a former sheriff whose district includes the property, has led efforts to clean it, protect wildlife and plants in the area, and make it attractive to families.

Last summer, county supervisors passed an ordinance that bans overnight camping, dogs, fires, fireworks, amplified music and accumulating trash on Tunitas Creek Beach. Authorities, who have begun ticketing violators, also put up no-parking signs along Highway 1 and Tunitas Creek Road, where many of the overnight party-goers were leaving their cars. Horsley also has led efforts to hire two new park rangers to increase oversight.

“For many years, this was one of those ‘best kept secrets’ enjoyed by a few people,” said Horsley on Friday at a news conference to unveil the state money. “Then social media exploded and it became a destination for hundreds of people almost every weekend. With so many people coming to party, camp out, and use this beach as a rave location, it eventually became known as a not-so-secret disaster waiting to happen. The beauty of the beach was being lost to the environmental damage being done to it.”

The funding was inserted into the state budget by State Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, Assemblyman Marc Berman, D-Los Altos, and Assemblyman Kevin Mullin, D-San Mateo. It will be distributed by the state Coastal Conservancy.

It should take about three years, perhaps less, said Moore, for the parking lot, trails and restrooms to be finished. An old ramshackle home on the bluffs will either be torn down or converted to a ranger residence, he said.

The beach is technically open to the public now because all beaches in California are publicly owned up to the mean high-tide line, or the area where the sand is wet. But it’s difficult to access.

Studies have shown that endangered steelhead trout live in Tunitas Creek and that the beach is home to snowy plovers, a rare bird. The vast beach, with cliffs more than 100 feet tall on the northern edge, looks similar to Point Reyes National Seashore.

Famed Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola and his men camped along Tunitas Creek in 1769 during their expedition from Baja California to San Francisco Bay. The property was in private ownership for more than 100 years, its breathtaking cliffs and sand dunes hidden from motorists zooming along Highway 1 between Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay.

But at Friday’s news conference, Horsley predicted a different future for the stunningly beautiful coastline: “We are standing along a strip of beach that I truly believe will become known as one of the great public beach parks in California.”

By RUSS BYNUM and BRENDAN FARRINGTON 

MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Rescuers intensified efforts Saturday to find survivors who might be trapped amid the ruins of a small Florida Panhandle community nearly obliterated by Hurricane Michael, where one body has already been recovered, tempers are flaring, and power could be out for weeks. 

 
Crews with dogs went door-to-door in Mexico Beach, pushing aside debris to get inside badly damaged structures in a second wave of searches following what they described as an initial, “hasty” search of the area. About 1,700 search and rescue personnel have checked 25,000 homes, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. 

Authorities say there is little doubt the death toll will rise from the storm, which made landfall Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with 155 mph winds (249 kph) and heavy storm surge. The tally of lives lost across the South stood at 15, including the victim found in the rubble of Mexico Beach, where about 1,000 people live. 

“Everything is time consuming,” said Capt. Ignatius Carroll, of the South Florida Urban Search and Rescue task force. “You don’t want to put a rush on a thorough rescue.” 

More roads were passable along the storm-ravaged coast as crews cleared downed trees and power lines, but traffic lights remained out and long lines heightened tensions at one of the area’s few open gas stations. 

“I want you to get back in your vehicle and stop!” one woman shouted at a man accosting her as she tried to squeeze her car between two idling vehicles at a Panama City service station running two fuel pumps on a generator. 

“You’re an idiot!” the man shouted back. 

About 4,000 members of Florida’s national guard have been called up to deal with the storm, including 500 added on Saturday. Nearly 2,000 law-enforcement officials have been sent into the Panhandle. 

					
				

Schools will stay closed indefinitely, a hospital halted operations and sent 200 patients to hospitals elsewhere in Florida and in Alabama, and more than 253,000 customers in the Panhandle remain without power. 

“Everybody just needs to help each other right now,” Scott said after meeting with emergency responders in the Panama City area. 

“You feel sorry for people,” Scott said. “They might have lost their house. They worry about their kids getting into school. You know, people don’t sit and have a whole bunch of extra money in the bank just waiting for a disaster.” 

Some residents were packing up and getting as far away as they could. 

Jeff and Katrina Pearsey, with a ruined rental home in the Panama City area and no indication of when they could again earn a living, said they were heading to Bangor, Maine, where Katrina once worked as a nurse. Several trees came down on their property, including one that smashed through the roof. 

“We’re getting our stuff and we’re going,” said Jeff Pearsey, 48. “We’re probably done with Panama City.” 

Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever make landfall in the U.S. While most residents fled ahead of the storm’s arrival, others stayed to face the hurricane. Some barely escaped with their lives as homes were pushed off their foundations and whole neighborhoods became submerged. 

Hector Morales, a 57-year-old restaurant cook, never even thought of evacuating. His mobile home wasn’t on the beach but when it suddenly began floating during the hurricane, he jumped out and swam to a fishing boat and clambered aboard. 

“I lost everything,” Morales said. “But I made it.” 

How many others were not so fortunate was still not clear. By one count, state officials said, 285 people in Mexico Beach defied mandatory evacuation orders and stayed behind. It’s unclear how many people stayed behind in nearby communities. 

One who did, Albert Blackwell, was preparing on Saturday to cover holes in the roof of his apartment and take a chain saw to trees that fell and broke his windows just outside Panama City. 

“I’m the idiot that rode it out here in this place,” said Blackwell, 65, sweat dripping from his face. He doesn’t plan to leave; he wants to protect his home from looters. 

Emergency officials said they’ve received thousands of calls asking about missing people, but with cellphone service out across a wide area, they found it impossible to know who among those unaccounted for were safe but just unable to dial out to friends or family. 

Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long said he expected the death toll to rise. Searchers were trying to determine if the person found dead in Mexico Beach had been alone or was part of a family. 

Authorities have set up distribution centers to dole out food and water to victims. They’ve also set up a triage tent to treat residents stepping on nails and cutting themselves on debris. 

President Donald Trump announced plans to visit Florida and hard-hit Georgia early next week but didn’t say what day he would arrive. On Saturday he approved federal disaster aid relief for four Alabama counties affected by the storm. 

“We are with you!” he tweeted.

						Tiffany Haddish and Kevin Hart star in the new comedy “Night School.”		
	
By Randy Myers, Correspondent | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: September 26, 2018 at 11:00 am | UPDATED: September 26, 2018 at 2:18 pm


Comedians Tiffany Haddish and Kevin Hart team up in “Night School,” director Malcolm D. Lee’s follow-up to hs raunchy and hilarious “Girls Trip.” But while the premise doesn’t sound very novel — a group of so-called adults gather to earn their GEDs and lunacy, of course, ensues —  the two stars hopefully will spice it up.

If you love quirky Westerns, mosey over to “The Sisters Brothers.” John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix play the titular siblings journeying through the 1850’s Wild West and rustling up trouble and old family issues. Riz Ahmed, Jake Gyllenhaal and Carol Kane costar.

In the animated family film “Small Foot,” an isolated community of yetis happen upon a curious entity called a human. Channing Tatum, Zendaya and Common provide the voices in this tuneful enterprise.

The talented Keira Knightley is exceptional in “Colette,” a frisky biopic about the French author who defied the sexism of the 20th century and fought to get credit for the books she more than co-wrote with her philandering husband (a standout Dominic West). Wash Westmoreland’s gorgeous period piece is both funny and topical. It’s impeccably made to boot.

Speaking of books and authors, one of the most beloved classics — Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women” — receives a contemporary redo as the four March sisters lean on each other in challenging times. It marks actress/writer/producer Clare Niederpruem’s feature-length debut. Lea Thompson stars.

Docs on parade

The bustling documentary scene continues to impress and this week’s four titles further serve to indicate there’s ample to choose from.

Cinephiles should beeline to “Hal,” a deep dive into the filmmaking genius of Hal Ashby, the director behind classics such as “Being There” and “Harold and Maude.”

If you love rock ‘n’ roll, head for “Bad Reputation,” Kevin Kerslake’s eye-opening look at Joan Jett and her hardscrabble career before that song turned her into a sensation.

“Bisbee ‘17,” shines a light on a horrifying chapter in history by focusing on a small town in Arizona that stages a 100th-year reenactment of an incident when when the community rounded up striking workers and carted them out to the desert to die.

					
				

A family-friendly gem is “Science Fair,”  a sparkling celebration of the ingenuity and inventiveness of young minds from Cristina Costantini and Darren Foster. The filmmakers follow nine students competing in a global science fair. You’ll love it.

B-movies and streamers

“The Church” presents us with Clint Howard as a priest in a parish that rattles the undead because of real estate shenanigans. In “Hell Fest,” a carnival turns into a bloody attraction for a serial killer.

Too gruesome for you? Then relax in the comfy narrative confines of “Cruise,” Robert D. Siegel’s romance that’s mostly a smooth ride with a perky ‘80s soundtrack and two charismatic leads, Spencer Boldman and Emily Ratajkowski.

Action fans can expect to get their fill of kicks with “Golden Job,” Chin Ka Lok’s heist-gone-awry flick in which the intended cargo — medicine — turns out to be gold.

Meanwhile, Netflix keeps it intense with “Hold the Dark,” a tension-filled drama about the relationship that develops between a wolf expert (Jeffrey Wright) and a grieving mother (Riley Keough) in a remote area of Alaska. Alexander Skarsgard costars.

			By spending more time on the aftermath than on the crime itself, the filmmaker loses some of the urgency of his other movies. But the performances, particularly Danielsen Lie's icily self-involved killer, are suitably intense.

By Jennifer Jacobs | Bloomberg News
PUBLISHED: April 5, 2018 at 6:50 am | UPDATED: April 5, 2018 at 7:00 am


Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz criticized the bidding process for a huge Pentagon cloud computing contract in a private dinner with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, complaining that it seemed designed for Amazon.com to win, according to people familiar with the matter.

Trump heard her out and said he wants the contract competition to be fair, but made no indication he’d interfere in the bidding, the people said. Oracle, where Catz shares the CEO title with Mark Hurd, is competing with Amazon for the contract, a point she didn’t emphasize to Trump, the people said.

The president has repeatedly attacked Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, and the multibillion-dollar Defense Department contract for cloud computing services is a potential opportunity to hurt the company.

Trump invited venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a longtime supporter, to dine with him at the White House, and Thiel brought Catz as one of his guests.

Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Oracle declined to comment.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump isn’t interfering in the contract decision.

“The president is not involved in the process,” Sanders said at her press briefing Wednesday, adding that the Defense Department “runs a competitive bidding process.”

The Pentagon intends to award a single contract for multiyear cloud services. The contract could go to one team made up of multiple companies. That plan has drawn criticism from lawmakers as well as Amazon competitors including Microsoft, International Business Machines and industry groups that include Oracle. They’re worried the plan will favor Amazon, which is dominant in the cloud services market.

					
				

Pentagon officials said Amazon wasn’t pre-selected — nor was any company.

“We have no favorites. We want the best solution for the department,” said Navy Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman.

The Defense Department has said it wants to shift to the cloud for a tactical edge on the battlefield and to modernize its technology infrastructure. A final request for proposals, which outlines a contract as long as 10 years, is scheduled to be released in May with an award by the end of September.

Amazon Web Services is Amazon’s fastest-growing and most profitable business, subsidizing its international e-commerce expansion and investments in video streaming and devices. Its profits help satisfy investors while Bezos pumps money into long-term initiatives that aren’t profitable. Amazon had operating income of $4.1 billion on sales of $178 billion in 2017, and it would have lost money without AWS.

Trump has repeatedly attacked Amazon in a series of tweets since March 29 that initially drove down the company’s market value by as much as $55 billion before Tuesday. He has not publicly mentioned the Defense Department contract.

But the president has repeatedly shown his willingness to publicly weigh in on Pentagon contracting decisions.

As president-elect, he criticized costs for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet as “out of control” and let the CEO of rival Boeing listen in on a call to the Air Force general managing the program. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis later agreed to conduct a study into developing an advanced version of Boeing’s older Super Hornet fighter as an alternative. No report was ever issued.

Trump eventually embraced the F-35, taking credit for reduced costs in a contract that already was under negotiation when he entered office.

He also asked Boeing to cut costs for new Air Force One planes and boasted of securing savings.

But he hasn’t yet sought to put his thumb on the scale in the middle of a contract competition, which would risk a lawsuit by a losing company protesting White House interference.

“We don’t do procurement by tweet. It doesn’t exist. The president actually has no say in the specific award of a contract,” said Stan Soloway, president of consulting firm Celero Strategies and a former Defense official under President Bill Clinton. “Any political interference at all would be illegal and inappropriate.”

Other topics discussed at the dinner Tuesday night included national security issues and North Korea.

By Amy Dickinson | Tribune Content Agency
PUBLISHED: October 12, 2018 at 6:00 am | UPDATED: October 13, 2018 at 4:42 pm


Columnist Amy Dickinson (Bill Hogan/Chicago Tribune) 
DEAR AMY: My parents have taken in my 95-year-old grandfather. Money is not a problem, so he could have gone into a nursing home or into assisted living. My grandfather has six other kids, and no one else wanted him to live with them.

I feel as if I have lost my parents until my grandfather passes. I’ll invite them to come to their grandchild’s “grandparent day” at school, and it’s, “No, we can’t leave Dad alone,” or, “Oh, we can’t make it to the twins’ birthday party, because we can’t leave Dad.”

I live almost two hours away, and my grandfather won’t go anyplace other than the doctor or church. No other family member is available or trustworthy enough to watch him.
Amy, this could go on for years!

I was never close to him. He is difficult to get along with and could not tell you one thing about me as a child, because he (and my grandmother, who died years ago) didn’t take an interest in most of their grandchildren. Fortunately, my other grandparents were total rock stars, so I was not deprived.

Every time I talk to my mother now, it’s all about my grandfather. I DON’T CARE!

Short of cutting off ties with my parents, what am I supposed to do? I expressed all my opposition to this before he moved in. I said that it was a bad idea. I was not listened to.

I do still try to visit them once a month, but it’s hard. I work full time and have to do things like take care of my kids’ laundry and buy groceries.

My folks used to travel to see us once or twice a month — sometimes more often.

					
				

I miss my parents, and my kids miss their grandparents!

Want Them Back

DEAR WANT: As much as I would like to answer your letter by saying, “I DON’T CARE!,” I won’t do that, because I have a shred of compassion toward you. And you should have a shred of compassion toward your parents. It is hard to imagine that these people you are so desperate to spend time with raised such a selfish, self-centered person.

For the next phase of their lives, your folks are going to be wrapped up in this hard thing they are doing. Your mother is going to be at least as concerned about your grandfather as you are about your kids’ laundry. So yes, for now her life will be all about him. Deal with it.

You should suck it up, and find ways to support your parents during this challenging time. If you want to see them, take the kids to visit. It would probably be good for your children to witness some multigenerational loving kindness.

DEAR AMY: I need advice on how to help my sister. Betsy was married for eight years to a guy who lied, took drugs and was verbally abusive. Thank goodness, they got divorced two years ago.

Since then she has tried flirting with some guys at her work, only to be shot down. Basically, they only like her as a friend.

She briefly tried online dating, again without much success. She talked to a couple of guys (at different times) who said they would like to get to know her better, but they ghosted her after she suggested meeting in person.

This has led to loneliness and self-pity. She says she wishes she was numb so she doesn’t have to feel the heartache.

Amy, she is a sweetheart. She is smart and very caring. How can I help her out of this downward spiral?

Worried Sister

DEAR WORRIED SISTER: Rather than focusing too intensively on your sister’s dating problems, you should encourage her to work on some social and friendship skills, in order for her to become more self-actualized. Professional counseling or coaching will help. When she feels better and more in control, she’ll have an easier time coping with her meeting and dating challenges.

And dating is a challenge for everyone. Your sister will need both confidence and patience.

DEAR AMY: “The Invisible Wife” was lonely because her husband concentrated more on his laptop and his phone than on her.

I was at a restaurant the other night and the next table had a party of four (a family) who did not exchange one word with each other, as they stared at their phones the entire time.

Discouraged

DEAR DISCOURAGED: Our addiction to technology is affecting relationships. We all need to be more intentional.

	WATCH: Draymond Green says sports should do away with ‘owner’ title

		
	Logan Murdock
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 17, 2018 at 2:09 pm | UPDATED: September 18, 2018 at 4:44 am

		Golden State Warriors, Sports

Draymond Green has an alternative title for team owners in sports.
“CEO or chairman,” Green said in a bonus clip of HBO’s The Shop released Sunday.
In the NSFW clip, which includes Snoop Dogg, Jon Stewart and Lakers star LeBron James, the subject of ownership in sports is thrown out, causing mixed reactions. While Snoop and James’ business partner Maverick Carter seemed to agree that the owner titles should remain, Green had other ideas.



“When you think of a basketball team, you don’t think of the Golden State Warriors and think of [the Bay Bridge logo on the team’s jersey],” Green said. “You think of the players that make that team.”
Green latest comments on ownership are consistent with what he’s said over the past few years. Last season, after Houston Texans owner Bob McNair, called NFL players “inmates,” Green lashed out on Instagram.
“Let’s stop using the word owner and maybe use the word Chairman,” Green’s caption read. “To be owned by someone just sets a bad precedent to start. It sets the wrong tone. It gives one the wrong mindset. Webster states that an inmate is a person confined to an institution such as a prison or hospital. Not sure these tax paying men should be referred to as inmates.”
Green lashed out again during a speaking engagement at Harvard days later, after Mavericks owner Mark Cuban asked for an apology for Green’s initial comments.

“Very rarely do we take the time to rethink something and say, ‘maybe that’s not the way,'” Green said. “Just because someone was taught that 100 years ago, doesn’t make that the right thing today. And so, when you look at the word ‘owner,’ it really dates back to slavery. The word ‘owner,’ ‘master’ — it dates back to slavery. … We just took the words and we continued to put it to use.”

Rishi Kumar ‘out front’

on today’s key issues

As a 50-year Saratoga resident, I am endorsing Rishi Kumar to be re-elected to the Saratoga City Council.

He has been active on the council during his first term. He is “out front” on all the important issues today: Neighborhood Watch, safety, burglaries, high-water bills. He is a good communicator and organizer, and possesses “boundless energy.”

PUBLISHED: July 11, 2018 at 9:09 am | UPDATED: July 11, 2018 at 4:38 pm


The well-used Historic De Anza Trail in Cupertino might soon become an official bike path and walking trail. But first, some longtime owners of the trail will need convincing.

In March, city officials and Alta Planning & Design began gathering feedback on the possibility of formalizing an already popular dirt path that has been used by residents for decades. The proposed 5-mile stretch of trail would run alongside the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and start from Saratoga’s Joe’s Trail where it would connect with the Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve.

“Five years ago the city hadn’t spent a dime in years related to bicycles and pedestrians,” said Larry Dean, the founder of the bicycle and pedestrian advocacy group Walk Bike Cupertino. “You roll the clock forward and they’ve committed all these funds.”

In 2016, the Cupertino City Council made that switch to bring bicycle and pedestrian safety to the forefront when they adopted the Bicycle Transportation Plan. In it was a new vision for Cupertino’s trails dubbed “The Loop.” The proposed network of trails – which includes the Historic De Anza Trail – would take cyclists and pedestrians away from the rush and dangers of traffic.

“The safest place for people who bicycle is where there are not cars,” Dean said. “Of course if you have off-road trails there are not cars. This is an opportunity to put a feature in town that would achieve that.”

But this isn’t the first time that Cupertino has tried to formalize the trail. Previous efforts to pave or improve the rocky dirt path have been blocked by the Union Pacific Railroad since they own the land.

“I think they are more open to the idea than they have been in the past, but a lot remains to be seen as we move forward,” Project Manager Chris Corrao said.

Another issue that Corrao said the city would have to grapple with during the feasibility study is identifying other property owners along the proposed trail. The Santa Clara Valley Water District and other utility companies own land throughout the 5-mile stretch.

But while the Union Pacific Railroad may be harder to convince, Corrao and Dean both said they believed the general public is on their side.

					
				

“I think that because it’s already an open trail that people use, they see this as a trail in their mind,” Corrao said. “They look at it as formalizing a trail versus a completely new trail where none has been before.”

In June, the city hosted two pop-up events and an Open House to spread the word about the proposed trail and garner feedback. Corrao said that 40-60 people attended each pop-up event and over 50 people showed up to the Open House.

Comment cards, which can be found on the project’s website, were overall positive and had numerous suggestions for connecting the trail with the community.

“Allow access from homes on both sides of the tracks, please!” one resident wrote. “We like having the trail (and) would be glad for the trail to be improved.”

Now that the city has heard from some of the public, Corrao said that city officials and Alta Planning & Design will finish reviewing the feedback. According to the project website, another public meeting is slated for an undetermined date in November.

Those interested in staying up to date with the proposed Historic De Anza Trail can visit the project website at cupertino.org/deanzatrail.

By Justin Jouvenal | The Washington Post

SACRAMENTO  – Detectives had searched for four decades for the clue that would unlock the identity of the Golden State Killer, the predator who terrorized California top to bottom with a string of horrific rapes and murders in the ’70s and ’80s.

Criminal DNA databases produced no hits, sweeps of crime scenes no fingerprints and hefty rewards no definitive tips. But Paul Holes, an investigator and DNA expert, had a hunch he could create a road map to the killer through his genetics.

Holes used DNA recovered from a crime scene to find the killer’s great-great-great grandparents, who lived in the early 1800s. Branch by painstaking branch, he and a team created about 25 family trees containing thousands of relatives down to the present day.

One fork led to a 72-year-old retiree who was quietly living out his golden years in the Sacramento suburb of Citrus Heights. Holes was intrigued after learning the man was a disgraced cop who had bought guns during two sprees by the killer.

The test of Holes’ novel sleuthing would come in mid-April, when officers scooped an item the man discarded containing his DNA and tested it against the killer’s. The shot in the dark produced a match – an improbable ending fit for detective fiction.

Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested in Citrus Heights on April 24.

“Everything else up to this time had failed,” Holes said. “For 44 years, law enforcement has been trying to solve this case. No other case has had more resources poured into it in the history of California. I was just stunned.”

					
				

The role of genetics in the case is well known, but this account reveals for the first time the massive scope, intricate science and sheer doggedness of the effort to catch one of the nation’s worst serial predators.

Initial DNA work identified distant relatives – not a suspect. Holes said a team of five investigators spent four months building out family trees, name by name. They pored over census records, newspaper obituaries, gravesite locators and police and commercial databases to find each relative and, ultimately, DeAngelo.

The Golden State Killer was as clever a criminal as he was sadistic, taunting authorities and staying one step ahead as police say he killed at least 12 people, raped more than 50 and committed 100 burglaries between 1974 and 1986, when his crimes appeared to mysteriously end.

His mayhem touched 10 counties, and he was variously called the East Area Rapist, Original Nightstalker, Diamond Knot Killer and Visalia Ransacker, before authorities discovered the various crime sprees appeared to be the work of a single man.

He instilled fear like few others.

Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert was a child when the suspect carried out dozens of rapes in the Sacramento area in 1976 and ’77. Schubert said her mother put a weapon under her pillow.

“It changed this community,” Schubert said. “People referred to him as the boogeyman. It wasn’t a matter of if he was coming, it was when, because it happened so much and it went on for so long.”

The boogeyman

The horror began with the flash of a blinding light.

Linda O’Dell, then 22, said she and her husband were woken around 1 or 2 a.m. on May 14, 1977, by an intruder shining a flashlight on their bed.

“Don’t move,” the man barked.

He threw string to O’Dell and ordered her to tie up her husband. Then the intruder tied O’Dell up himself. He piled plates and bowls on her husband’s back and stalked around the house yelling and drinking the couple’s beer. Finally, he moved O’Dell to the living room, where he raped her.

“He told me he would cut my husband’s ear off and bring it to me if there was any noise,” she said.

He eventually took O’Dell’s wedding ring, possibly as a souvenir, then slipped out into the night.

The three-hour ordeal bore the terrible hallmarks of a predator who came to be dubbed the East Area Rapist. The rape of O’Dell was number 21 attributed to the same man in the Sacramento area in 1976 and ’77. Thirty more would follow there and in other communities in northern California.

“This was the most heinous rapist I had ever known,” said former detective Carol Daly, who was one of the first to investigate the case for the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department. “The attacks were bizarre, cruel and long-lasting.”

They were also cunning, said Richard Shelby, another former detective with the department. Shelby said the East Area Rapist planned meticulously. He watched the victims, broke into their homes and even called them to learn their routines before striking. He always seemed to have an escape route via a stream, trail or field.

With each attack, fear ratcheted higher.

Sales of locks, dogs and guns soared – doubling in Sacramento County between ’76 and ’77, according to the Sacramento Bee. Daly said burglaries nosedived during that era; she surmised it was because of the gun sales and burglars knowing residents were on edge.

But what truly seemed to set the East Area Rapist apart, Daly said, was his apparent delight in stoking this public terror.

At a forum on the rapes in 1977, Daly recalled a man rose and said he doubted a rapist would be able to rape a woman in front of her husband, since the man would retaliate. Several months later, that man’s wife was raped while he was at home, Daly said.

“I can’t positively say, but I think the rapist was in the meeting that night,” she said.

Despite intense searches, Shelby said, the East Side Rapist seemed to anticipate police moves and slip away. At the time, DeAngelo was a police officer in the small northern California town of Auburn.

If DeAngelo is the East Side Rapist, Shelby thinks his police training may have given him an edge. His police radio may have even allowed him to listen in as police investigated.

The violence grew.

In February 1978, a young couple from Rancho Cordova, Brian and Katie Maggiore, were shot dead when they fled a confrontation on the street while walking their dog. The killings eventually became the first attributed to the East Area Rapist.

The year after the killings, DeAngelo was dismissed from the Auburn force for shoplifting a can of dog repellent and a hammer from a drugstore.

The terror soon shifted to southern California, although it’s unclear what DeAngelo was doing or where he was living.

Shortly after Christmas in 1979, a surgeon and a psychologist were shot and killed in their Santa Barbara County apartment. In March 1980, a couple was bludgeoned to death with a piece of firewood in their Ventura County home. The woman was raped. Six more murders would follow, all believed to be the work of a killer who was dubbed the Original Nightstalker.

By 1986, that crime spree appeared to abruptly end.

The reason remains unknown, but Daly and Shelby think the killer may have grown too old to continue the physically demanding attacks and flights. In 2001, DNA evidence linked the East Area Rapist and Original Nightstalker cases.

The search for the Golden State Killer helped spur advances in criminal justice. The brother of one victim successfully lobbied to expand the collection of DNA from criminals in California, and the Sacramento Sheriff’s Department added a dedicated sex crimes unit.

The final push to find the killer would spawn one more investigative innovation.

Road map to a killer

Paul Holes had been tracking the Golden State Killer for 24 years, but time was running out. He had nine months before he retired as an investigator for the Contra Costa County district attorney’s office, and he desperately wanted to crack his biggest case.

Oda/Bay Area News Group) Laura Oda/Bay Area News Group
Holes had been obsessed with the Golden State Killer since coming across the case file in the mid-’90s while working as a forensic scientist. Holes had handled serial predator cases, but the Golden State Killer stood out even among these hardened offenders.

“I was struck by the lengths this predator would go to to instill fear in his victims,” Holes said. “It was psychological terror.”

A detective told Holes about a 2002 case in which a young kidnapping victim was identified using her DNA and a genealogy website. Holes wondered: Could he do the same with the Golden State Killer?

Holes began researching and hit upon a novel tool in GEDmatch, a no-frills website that allows users to upload their genetic information and search a database of roughly a million profiles for possible family connections.

He prepared to sell the unorthodox idea to officials to get a sample of the killer’s DNA.

“We ended up going on a road show,” Holes said.

Holes and an FBI lawyer found a partner in Ventura County last summer. A meticulous pathologist had put a duplicate evidence kit from the rape and murder of Charlene and Lyman Smith in a freezer in 1980. Many other DNA samples from the case had been depleted over the years.

A lab converted the sample into a format that could be read by GEDmatch, which analyzes hundreds of thousands of DNA datapoints to determine relatedness. Holes waited anxiously as he fed in the killer’s profile.

Holes, prepared for another dead end, was heartened when the analysis returned. It wasn’t a close match, but the site found 10 to 20 distant relatives of the killer, roughly the equivalent of third cousins.

Holes knew that if he traced back the lineages of distant cousins far enough he could find a common ancestor they shared with the killer. That turned out to be great-great-great grandparents from the early 1800s.

A daunting task lay ahead as Holes and his team began to trace offspring to the present day to find potential suspects. That meant filling in thousands of blanks.

“When you go that far back in time, you have trees that grow huge,” Holes said.

They used census data, old newspaper clippings and a gravesite locator to find the deceased relatives. When they got to the current day, they turned to police databases and websites such as Lexis Nexis.

Holes created his family trees using a tool on ancestry.com. His team stole time on weekends and during meetings to plug the holes one by one. It was tedious work, and it wasn’t their full-time focus.

By April, they had pieced together about 25 distinct family trees from the great-great-great grandparents. There were roughly 1,000 family members just in the one that included DeAngelo.

The team began scouring the trees for potential suspects, men about the killer’s age who had connections to Sacramento and other locations of the crimes.

They found two.

Holes said the other suspect looked promising on paper but was eventually eliminated by a DNA test of a relative. That left DeAngelo.

Holes had doubts. “How could this guy be a full-time law enforcement officer and be committing all these attacks across northern California?” he said. “I had my reservations that it was him.”

Sacramento sheriff’s deputies put DeAngelo under surveillance and picked up the discarded item containing his DNA. After the hit, they arrested DeAngelo at his home, not far from where he allegedly carried out many of his crimes. He now faces eight counts of murder.

On Friday, DeAngelo, whose attorney did not return calls for comment for this report, was pushed into a Sacramento courtroom in a wheelchair to face arraignment. He appeared frail in an orange jumpsuit, answering a judge’s questions in a thin, raspy voice.

Holes said he was gratified to finally put a face to the ghost he chased for so many years.

“Thousands of nightmares and thousands of sleepless nights have been put to an end with the capture of this rapist,” said Carol Daly.

						It was imprecise for Crash Davis (Kevin Costner’s character in “Bull Durham”) to say that strikeouts are “fascist,” but he was right that they are “boring,” at least in excessive quantities.		
	
By George F. Will | The Washington Post
PUBLISHED: July 16, 2018 at 12:45 pm | UPDATED: July 17, 2018 at 4:10 am


WASHINGTON — It is a prudential axiom: If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it. This reflects the awareness that things can always be made worse, and the law of unintended consequences, which is that they often are larger than and contrary to intended ones. With baseball’s all-star game at hand amid lamentations about several semi-broken aspects of it, it is time to amend the axiom: Don’t fix it even if it is broken.

The itch to fix complex systems often underestimates the ability of markets, broadly understood, to respond and adapt to incentives. So, even if you are an unsatisfactory American — i.e., uninterested in baseball — read on, because the debate about some of the game’s current defects contains lessons about lesser things than baseball, meaning everything else.

Today’s all-or-nothing baseball is too one-dimensional. There are too many strikeouts — for the first time in history, more than hits, a lot more. And the number is increasing for the 13th consecutive season. Also, too many of the hits are homeruns. It was imprecise for Crash Davis (Kevin Costner’s character in “Bull Durham”) to say that strikeouts are “fascist,” but he was right that they are “boring,” at least in excessive quantities. So are home runs (and caviar, and everything else except martinis). In about one-third of today’s at-bats, the ball is not put in play (home run balls are put in the seats). Sports Illustrated’s Tom Verducci notes that by the end of June there were “more strikeouts in half a season than there were in the entire 1980 season.” And “on average, you have to wait [3 minutes and 45 seconds] between balls put in play — 41 seconds longer between movement than 20 years ago.” Steals (hence pitchouts), sacrifice bunts, hit-and-run plays — interesting things for fans — are becoming rarer.

This is not the main reason attendance is down. The weather is: In 35 April games, the temperature was below 40; in the entire 2017 season, only one. But the all-or-nothing style is not helping, and it is encouraged by the exponential increase in the use of defensive shifts — from 2,357 in 2011 to a projected 36,000 this season.

The best-known early use of the shift, in 1946, overloaded the right side against Ted Williams, who regally said they could not put the shift high enough. Actually, he tried to hit through, not over, it, but after the shift began, his average that year went from .354 to .327. Today, the 99.999 percent of players who are lesser hitters elevate their bats’ “launch angles,” exacerbating the all-or-nothing style.

Also, shifts cause pitchers to target a particular part of the plate in order to increase the probability that the batter will hit into the shift. This results in more walks, which batters like because high on-base percentages are rewarded: Today, baseball’s compensation system is an incentive for walks, and for equanimity about striking out, if home runs are frequent.

What baseball people call “analytics,” and less-scientific people call information, has produced all this: Particular hitters have particular tendencies; defenses adjust accordingly. Now, let us, as the lawyers say, stipulate that more information is always better than less. But for the moment, information is making offense anemic. So, there is a proposal afoot — this is fascism — to ban shifts, to say there must be two infielders on either side of second base, or even that as the pitch is delivered all infielders must be on the infield dirt. This would leave some, but much less, ability to manage defenses. It would, however, short-circuit market-like adjustments.

Incessant radical shifting will persist until it is moderated by demand summoning a supply of some Rod Carew-like hitters. A Hall of Famer, Carew was a magician who wielded a bat like a wand, spraying hits hither and yon, like Wee Willie (“Hit ’em where they ain’t”) Keeler. The market is severely meritocratic, so some hitters who cannot modify their tendencies and learn to discourage shifts by hitting away from them might need to consider different careers.

Baseball — the game on the field, not just the business side — resembles a market system because constantly evolving strategies create demands for different tactics, and thus different skills, which are then supplied by persons and teams that are eager to excel in the new forms of competition. Before restricting managers’ and players’ interesting choices by limiting shifts (and certainly before softening the ball; or moving the pitcher more than 60 feet, 6 inches from the plate), give the market — freedom for fan-pleasing ingenuity and adaptation — a chance.

						Monta Vista High School’s Jake Kokeny, shown singling against Lynbrook earlier this season, pitched a great game against Fremont last week.

If the Monta Vista Matadors come up short in their bid to capture the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League’s El Camino Division baseball championship this year, it will most likely be because of Saratoga’s ace right-hander Nathan Peng.

For the second time in three meetings between the two schools this season, Peng silenced Monta Vista’s normally potent bats in a 12-0 shutout. Saratoga was a game ahead of the Mats  in the El Camino standings as the teams entered the final week of the regular season.

Earlier this season, Peng blanked the Matadors 6-0. In two starts against Monta Vista, the Saratoga senior limited the Mats to a total of just seven hits while striking out 10.

In the only game that Peng did not throw against Monta Vista this year, the Matadors out-slugged the Falcons 17-13.

“Nathan throws harder than anyone else in the division. Some of our hitters had trouble catching up to his fastball, and most were not able to make hard contact,” said Monta Vista coach Skip Mueller. “I told his coach back in March that he had my vote for MVP. I’ve seen nothing to change my mind, and I don’t think there are any close contenders.”

In addition to twirling a pair of shutouts against Monta Vista, Peng, who is hitting a robust .543, torched Monta Vista pitching for seven hits in 12 at bats this season. The hit total includes two homers, a triple and a double, while scoring seven runs and driving in seven.

Monta Vista kept its hopes for an automatic berth in the upcoming Central Coast Section playoffs alive by bouncing back to nudge Fremont 4-1 last Thursday. The win kept the Matadors in sole possession of second place, although just a game in front of the Gunn Titans with two games left to play.

The Mats, who improved their league record to 9-4 and their overall mark to 14-11, scored all four of their runs against the last-place Firebirds in the top of the first inning.

After Jason Koontz led off with a walk, Ryan Hada singled to right and Sathya Kumaraguru singled to left, driving in Koontz.

					
				

Hada then scored on an infield error, and Nathan Hui singled to right, loading the bases. One out later, Anthony Moll, after falling behind 0-2 in the count, worked a walk to force in Kumaraguru.

A wild pitch allowed Josh Huang to score, capping the rally and Monta Vista’s scoring for the game.

The four runs were more than enough for Jake Kokeny to work with. Kokeny pitched six strong innings, yielding just three hits and a run while fanning a season-high seven batters to improve his record to 2-1 and lower his earned run average to 3.19.

“Jake kept it pretty basic, relying mostly on his fastball and mixing in some splitters,” noted Mueller.

Hui, making his first mound appearance of the season, recorded the save with a clean seventh inning in relief, striking out one.

In the SCVAL De Anza Division, the Homestead Mustangs remained in the hunt for a CCS at-large berth by edging Mountain View 8-7 last Friday.

The Mustangs improved to 7-7 in league play and to 17-10 overall, equaling the most wins they’ve had in a season since 2014.

Kyle Remahl picked up the win with two sharp innings of scoreless relief, improving his record to 3-0 while dropping his ERA to 1.62. Michael Dixson went 2-for-3 with a pair of RBI, lifting his team-leading batting average to .393.  Brendan Kane was 2-for-4 with two RBI, giving him hits in six of his last seven games and raising his batting average to .382.  Curran Ozawa-Burns also knocked in two runs, giving him the team lead entering this week with 20 for the year.

Softball

The King’s Academy Knights kept the pressure on front-running Notre Dame-Belmont by extending its winning streak to 10 games —  their longest such streak since 10 straight in 2007 — with convincing victories over Mercy, Notre Dame-San Jose and Castilleja.

Ilona Sullivan allowed a total of just three hits and one run while striking out 33 in three victories. She hurled The King’s Academy to a 13-1 triumph over Mercy on May 1, and back-to-back 15-0 shutouts over Notre Dame-San Jose and Castilleja.

The three wins pushed the Knights’ West Bay Athletic League-Foothill Division record to 10-2 and kept them within a half-game of first place Notre Dame-Belmont.

In addition to raising her personal record to 10-1 and lowering her earned run average to a microscopic 0.48, Sullivan extended her hitting streak to nine straight games by going 7-for-8 and driving in 10 runs in the three triumphs. Against Mercy, Sullivan, who raised her season batting average to a remarkable .706, went 4-for-4 with four runs scored and five RBI.

Kenzie Yamakoshi sparked The King’s Academy attack against Notre Dame-San Jose, lashing two triples and a double in four at bats and driving home three runs.

In the win over Castilleja, Malaya Street went 4-for-4 with three runs scored and two RBI, improving her batting average for the season to .562.

Highlights
Ballot returns show Ellenberg, president of the San Jose Unified School District board, holding a double-digit lead over former San Jose Councilman Pierluigi Oliverio, who was closely followed by San Jose City Councilman Don Rocha for the second spot on the fall ballot.


In a hotly contested primary race for Santa Clara County District 4 supervisor where accusations of sexual harassment sometimes drowned out a discussion of transportation, housing and other issues, Susan Ellenberg emerged as the top vote getter and likely will face former San Jose Councilman Pierluigi Oliverio in a November runoff, election results showed Wednesday morning.

Oliverio ended up with only 105 more votes than current San Jose Councilman Don Rocha for second place, according to the unofficial election results.

Ellenberg, president of the San Jose Unified School District board, had 32.1 percent of the vote to Oliverio’s 20.2 percent and Rocha’s 19.9 percent.

Just before midnight, Ellenberg said she was feeling “cautiously optimistic” about her chances after initial returns showed her well ahead of the next candidates.

“It looks like I have a very solid chance to be in the top two, so I’m definitely feeling grateful to the voters for this strong show of support and it’s gratifying to me that the message we are sharing that our county needs a strong advocate for families and children has really resonated with voters,” she said.

Seven candidates sought to replace termed-out Supervisor Ken Yeager. The race, marked by scandals and negative campaigning, took a dramatic turn when Dominic Caserta, considered a front-runner in some circles, dropped out and resigned from the Santa Clara City Council on May 15 after former campaign volunteers accused him of unwanted advances and impropriety and students at Santa Clara High School, where he taught civics, also surfaced with accusations. He has denied the allegations and on Tuesday his name still appeared on the ballot, where he held steady at fifth place.

Oliverio too had come under criticism by the Santa Clara County Democratic Party and various South Bay labor groups who questioned his suitability for the office, citing allegations of sexual harassment and verbal abuse against him in a 2014 lawsuit by his chief of staff Denelle Fedor while he was a sitting councilman five years ago. Fedor later dropped Oliverio from the lawsuit and settled with the city of San Jose for $10,000.

During the campaign, Ellenberg said she wants to expand housing access for all income groups and advocate for families, seniors and women who are survivors of domestic violence.

Oliverio ran a campaign that prioritized helping the severely mentally ill, reducing homelessness, putting county jail inmates to work cleaning roads and turning over dangerous undocumented immigrants to the feds.

					
				

The other candidates are Jason Baker, a former Campbell councilman and mayor, Maria Hernandez, a San Jose-based marketing consultant, and Mike Alvarado, an IT consultant and small business owner.

The November winner will represent an area that spans the cities of Santa Clara, Campbell and most of West San Jose and the unincorporated Cambrian and Burbank areas.

The toughest, fastest cowboys and cowgirls will be at center stage for the next two Fridays and Saturdays, Oct. 12-13 and Oct. 19-20, as the Bay Area hosts the Grand National Rodeo and the Professional Bull Riders.
Now in its 72nd year at the Cow Palace, the Grand National will feature nightly rodeo events, a horse show, a junior livestock show, agricultural exhibitions, mechanical bull rides, Western barbecue and live country music.
New this year are “Fables of the West” performances by an interactive cowboy comedy team and a ticket deal that gives four free Friday night tickets to first responders.


Admission is free for the horse show, livestock expo, interactive agricultural show and the Western marketplace, which is open from 2 to 11 p.m. each day.
Tickets for the rodeo events (bareback riding, steer wrestling, team roping and more) run $14 to $45. Competition hours are 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. all four days.
Details: Cow Palace, 2600 Geneva Ave., Daly City; www.cowpalace.com.

Maybe the gray whale wanted to be the first to hit the lagoons in Mexico.

Or perhaps the unusually warm water off the coast caused the wayward mammal to get an early start on its migration.

Whatever the estimated 35-foot gray whale was doing, it caused a buzz Monday, Aug. 27 along the Orange County shoreline — wowing spectators in Huntington Beach, stopping in Laguna Beach near the rocky outcroppings, then heading south to Dana Point where it spent some time in the shallow waters near the Ritz Carlton.

The whale first put on a show under the Huntington Beach Pier early Monday, as seen in a video posted to Twitter.

Then, charter boats found the whale as it cruised down the coast.

					
				

“I don’t even know what’s going on (in) the ocean anymore,” joked Chelsea Mayer, a naturalist and wildlife photographer for Newport Landing Whale Watching. She was aboard Newport Coastal Adventure when they spotted the whale off Laguna Beach.

“Just the fact that it’s down here so early, it should be just leaving Alaska,” she said. “It’s very, very strange.”

Mayer said the whale was rolling around in shallow water and didn’t appear to be underweight or sick. Unlike a juvenile spotted last summer inside harbors up and down Southern California, this whale seemed healthy and content.

“It seemed fine to me, I didn’t look at it and feel worried,” she said. “With the water being as warm as it is, maybe that threw it off…I don’t really know what he was doing, but it didn’t seem like it was under distress.”

 



Early start?

Gray whales are usually seen off Orange County’s coastline around Thanksgiving, with a few early sightings typical in October.

A sighting in August is a rarity.

Most gray whales are just leaving Alaska for their southbound migration, the longest of any mammal on Earth. They head to the warm water lagoons of Baja to give birth, passing Southern California along the way, before making their way back to Alaska typically in spring months.

“It was doing what I expect it to be doing — just in the wrong month,” Mayer said.

The fully-grown whale was later spotted by a captain aboard Dana Wharf Whale Watching, stopping in front of the Ritz Carlton to hang out in the shallow water, said Donna Kalez, manager for Dana Wharf.

“It’s very early,” said Kalez. “We’ve seen them in October. I don’t remember anything like this.

“Once in a while, we’ll see a gray whale not in the right place.”



 

She said there’s been a few not-so-normal animal sightings recently, like a hammerhead shark near the Dana Point harbor entrance on Tuesday afternoon.  Anglers have been catching tropical dorado, possibly as a result of warm water temperatures still lingering in the 70s off the coast.

Kalez wonders if the migration is kicking off earlier — or if it was just a fluke, a gray whale explorer out to see the sights.
“It’s a great sign. Maybe it’s luck,” she said. “But I don’t think we’ll start seeing a ton of gray whales… it’s very odd.”

						Los Gatos senior Sara Deck, controlling the ball in a game against Saratoga last fall, was named the CCS Player of the Year and the SCVAL’s Offensive Player of the Year after leading the Wildcats to CCS and league championships.		
	
By Dick Sparrer | dsparrer@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
January 12, 2017 at 6:24 am


Sara Deck experienced a lot in her four-year career as a field hockey player at Los Gatos High School—division and Central Coast Section championships, individual all-league and all-CCS recognition, and victories … many, many victories.

In fact, there was really only one thing that she never experienced: A loss.

Deck and her fellow four-year varsity players completed a perfect run through their high school careers, winning four Santa Valley Athletic League titles, taking four CCS crowns and posting an impressive 71-0 won-loss record.

And a big reason for that success? Clearly the play of Sara Deck.

For the second consecutive year, Deck has been named the CCS Player of the Year after leading the Wildcats to a section championship. In addition, she was tabbed the Offensive Player of the Year in the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League after playing a key role for the Wildcats as they rolled to a 12-0 record and the league title.

Joining Deck on the all-CCS list were Gina Gelphman, who was named the Goalie of the Year; Nicole Dal Cielo, Sydney Miller and Shelby Copper, each picked to the first team; Kate Kramer, Olivia Fox and Eva Vrijen, named to the second team; and Reegan McCluskey, Sophie Grant-Counard and Paige Parentice, recognized on the honorable mention list.

Deck also had plenty of company on the all-SCVAL team with teammates Miller and Vrijen joining her as special award winners and eight others claiming all-league spots.

While Deck was picking up the SCVAL’s Offensive Player of the Year award, Miller was winning the league’s Defensive Player of the Year honor and Vrijen was winning Sophomore of the Year plaudits.

Earning places on the all-league first team were Dal Cielo, Fox and Copper, claiming second-team honors were Kramer, Grant-Counard and McCluskey and winning honorable mention consideration were Gelphman and Parentice.

By Mark Gomez | mgomez@bayareanewsgroup.com, Robert Salonga | rsalonga@bayareanewsgroup.com and Jason Green | jason.green@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: July 25, 2018 at 12:29 pm | UPDATED: August 17, 2018 at 2:24 pm


SANTA CLARA — The death of a Campbell man discovered in Central Park last week has been ruled a homicide, and police believe that his co-worker killed him, authorities said.

In a news release issued Wednesday, Santa Clara police revealed that an autopsy had shown that the death of 54-year-old Campbell resident Raynard Hyde was a homicide. They also announced the arrest of 25-year-old Sunnyvale resident Gage Taren McCartney, described as a co-worker, in the killing.

The killing shocked local residents, who remembered Hyde as a popular butcher at the Safeway supermarket located a block from the park. The married father of three teenagers — one boy and two girls — was also known for his powerful singing voice at Cathedral of Faith church in San Jose, which he attended for the past three decades.



“The size of his voice matched the size of his heart,” said Kurt Foreman, the church’s director of operations and a long-time friend of Hyde’s. “He loved his family. He loved serving at the church. He is going to be deeply missed.”

Hyde was found Friday at 7:18 a.m., lying on the ground with a bloody nose near the duck pond at Central Park off Kiely Boulevard. Officers tried to revive him, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Hyde did not have any obvious signs of trauma to his body, police said, but detectives suspected foul play in an ensuing investigation.

“Investigators worked late into the night and through the weekend collecting evidence and interviewing friends and associates of the deceased,” police said in the news release.

The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office conducted an autopsy and affirmed those suspicions, ruling the death was a homicide.

					
				

Police said Hyde “was in the company” of McCartney before he was found dead. McCartney was arrested Wednesday night at his home and booked into the Santa Clara County Main Jail on suspicion of murder. The Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office has charged McCartney with murder, and an arraignment is tentatively scheduled for Friday.

The Cathedral of Faith, meanwhile, is working with Hyde’s family to plan a celebration of his life.

“He will be remembered for his big smile, his big voice that brought you into the presence of God when he sang,” Foreman said. “Ray was so beloved by so many people. It’s just tragic. This is just awful.”

						Salmon en papillote uses a very simple and fuss-free cooking method.

By Bibby Gignilliat | Correspondent
PUBLISHED: August 5, 2018 at 9:00 am | UPDATED: August 5, 2018 at 10:38 pm


En papillote is such an easy cooking method: You place proteins or vegetables into a folded paper pouch or parcel and bake it. It’s simple and delicious, and it works beautifully with salmon. This healthy meal is great for dinner parties and the paper packets make clean-up a breeze. You’ll need four pieces of parchment paper, each measuring 16 by 24 inches.

This recipe has a Moroccan slant to it thanks to its spices and flavorings. Pomegranate molasses is a Moroccan condiment: Pomegranate juice is cooked down until it becomes a thick syrup that adds tangy flavor to dishes. A lemon and lime mixture is drizzled over the fish for brightness, but you could use white wine instead.

Then wrap everything up, pop the parcels in the oven and cook them for 10 minutes per inch of filet thickness. If your fish is less than an inch thick, cook it for less time.

For company, serve these still in their parcels. Guests love to open them. It makes them feel like they are getting a present at the table!

Salmon en Papillote (Salmon Filets with Caramelized Shallots and Currants)

Serves 4

Ingredients:

¼ cup dried currants

¼ cup hot water

4 medium shallots

					
				

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 teaspoon good quality pomegranate molasses (or aged balsamic vinegar)

¼ teaspoon cinnamon

1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, plus 8 stem tops for garnish

4 salmon fillets, about 6 ounces each

Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons lemon juice

Juice of ½ a lime

Directions:

	Place currants in a bowl; pour hot water over them.  Let mixture stand, covered, for 20 minutes.
	Meanwhile, heat oven to 450 degrees. Cut out 4 pieces of parchment paper, each measuring 16 by 24 inches.
	Peel and halve shallots lengthwise and slice cross-wise ¼-inch thick.  In a small sauté pan set over moderately high heat, heat oil and cook shallots, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Reduce heat to moderate and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 15 minutes more (you may need to add some water if shallots start to burn).
	Add pomegranate molasses, the currant and hot water mixture, cinnamon, nutmeg, thyme leaves, ¼ teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes until the liquid is reduced. Transfer to a mixing bowl and cool.

Fold each parchment piece in half crosswise and cut to make a large round-ish heart shape.  Open the parchment heart and place a salmon fillet in the middle of one side. Sprinkle the fillet with salt and pepper. Spread a heaping spoonful of the caramelized shallot mixture on each fillet, and drizzle with lemon and lime juice. Fold the other side of the parchment over and crimp edges to form a tight seal around the papillote. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
	Place papillotes on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes, or until a skewer inserted through the parchment and into the fish slides smoothly. Serve immediately, cutting the packages open at the table.

UPDATES: 

Some evacuations were lifted on Saturday morning

The containment of the Holy fire almost tripled overnight, from 10 percent to 29 percent, even as the acres burned increased from 19,107 to 21,473, the Cleveland National Forest said Saturday morning.

*****

Water-dropping aircraft continued their assault on the fast-charging Holy fire – which swelled to an estimated 19,107 charred acres Friday evening, as several flare-ups occurred throughout the day in the Cleveland National Forest.

“We’re dealing with steep terrain, dry fuel and wind in the area,” said Thanh Nguyen, public information officer with SoCal Team 1, in charge of communications for the Holy Fire. “All of that contributes to fire behavior.”

The geographical area of Lake Elsinore contributes to the firefighting phenomenon known as the Elsinore Effect, Nguyen said. Usually, wildfires burn much slower downhill than uphill.

“What’s unique about the area, is that we will get a weather pattern that creates winds quickly moving down the mountainside,” he said. “That’s what we saw yesterday.”

The weather phenomenon has not manifested every day, Nguyen said.

					
				

The flames Friday afternoon threatened several properties that dot the winding roads near Highway 74 and Main Divide Road. Firefighters were focusing on the Coldwater Canyon area; Santiago Peak, home to communication towers for cell signals and law enforcement; and the Lake Elsinore neighborhoods including Horsethief Canyon, McVickers and El Cariso Village.

The flames were picking up on the north side of the fire about 2 p.m.

“We continue to actively engage, but cannot get ahead of the fire,” Cleveland National Forest officials said via Twitter on Friday.

Up to 3,000 structures are “moderately” threatened,” Nguyen said about 1:30 p.m.

Officially, 12 had burned, he said, though assessment teams were in the field to note any other damage. Most if not all burned in the forested communities of Holy Jim and Trabuco canyons in Orange County.

Dan Pritchett, a resident of the area for 30 years, said Friday morning his trailer home was destroyed by the blaze.

“I slept in the dirt last night,” he said as he attempted to get an old school bus running. He planned on driving the bus up the dirt road to his hilltop perch and live in it until he could rebuild.

He stayed at his property atop Main Divide Road Friday trying to put out hot spots.

Also Friday, the man accused of setting the Holy fire, Forrest Gordon Clark, 51, did not enter a plea at his arraignment Friday. He said the charges against him are “a lie” and that he would “easily” be able to raise the $1 million bail. Clark’s arraignment was rescheduled for Aug. 17.

The weather is expected to bend slightly in firefighters’ favor this weekend. The high temperature in Lake Elsinore on Friday was 96 degrees; the forecast for Saturday is 93 and 91 on Sunday with increasing humidity each day, said Jimmy Taeger, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Winds should remain at 5-10 mph with gusts of 13-20 mph.

The glow of the orange flames could be seen in the nearby hills. Despite 911 calls from worried residents of Brea and Anaheim, the fire was not endangering those cities, Nguyen said.

One firefighter had been reported injured Thursday. Other than the fact that he was alive, Nguyen didn’t have any details.

Two firefighting planes, an air tanker and a plane carrying a person who orchestrates the aerial operations, were forced to land at an airport after one or both were struck by birds. The planes were checked out, Nguyen said.

Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency Thursday in Riverside and Orange counties, a proclamation that will allow them to receive disaster assistance from the state. The order also waives fees for replacing vehicle records such as licenses and registrations destroyed by fire, and it eliminates the one-week waiting period for applying for unemployment benefits for those who have lost their job because of the fire.

The blaze reached 10 percent containment by late Friday. Containment is the percentage of the fire’s perimeter that firefighters have determined the blaze will no long spread beyond.

Cleveland National Forest officials say the Holy fire has left Orange County.


We have been receiving inquiries about the fire burning back towards #OrangeCounty. The fire is burning in Cold Water Canyon around Santiago Peak, & is not burning in OC. FFs are continuing firefighting effort in the area. #HolyFire @socalteam1

The Corona-Norco Unified School District announced that the start of the school year at Temescal Valley Elementary and Todd Academy would be postponed to Aug. 20.

The Highway 74 closure in Lake Elsinore was extended Friday to Lakeside High.  The southbound 15 Freeway off-ramp at Indian Truck Trail were closed until further notice, Caltrans said.  Both southbound and northbound off ramps at Lake Street in Lake Elsinore were closed during the morning hours, but re-opened in the afternoon.

Eastvale’s 65th Street Concerts in the Park Series event scheduled for Friday was postponed because of poor air quality. It has been rescheduled for 7:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 7. Moreno Valley’s movie and concert – featuring the band Wildfire – set for Friday was postponed to 6:45 p.m. Friday, Aug. 17, because of the air quality.

GoFundMe has provided a link to a webpage that lists verified campaigns to raise money for Holy fire-related causes. That page is gofundme.com/cause/holy-fire.

Pet assistance

Riverside County Animal Services is working on a plan to reunite displaced pets with their owners.

The plan includes transporting the evacuees’ pets directly back to them at the drop-off location at Temescal Canyon High, Animal Services Director Robert Miller said.

“We’re planning to use our animal control trucks as a Lyft or Uber service for people’s pets,” Miller said. “These residents have been through a lot. And we don’t think forcing them to drive a two-hour, round-trip journey to reunite with their pets is something that we’re comfortable with. Bringing the pets back to them seems to be a much better solution to better assist pet owners getting back to some state of normalcy.”

More information about this plan will be posted on Animal Services’ website — rcdas.org — and social media platforms.

Riverside County Animal Services’ number is 951-358-7387. Pet owners should know that this number kicks into an after hours, emergency service after 5 p.m. on weekdays and during most weekend hours.

Animal Friends of the Valleys in Wildomar is at capacity, but Riverside County Animal Services is still accepting animals at Temescal Canyon High and at the San Jacinto shelter, 581 S. Grand Ave.

Neither organization is charging board and care fees for the evacuated families.

Caution with ash

Riverside County’s public health officer, Dr. Cameron Kaiser, offered tips on safely dealing with the ash.

• Avoid activities that stir up ash.

• Do not allow children to play in ash.

• Wash ash off toys before children play with them.

• Clean ash off pets.

• Clean-up of larger quantities of ash should never be done by people who have lung or heart conditions.

• If you must clean up a larger quantity of ash, wear a tight-fitting respirator mask, gloves, long-sleeved shirts and long pants. The mask should cover your mouth and nose and seal properly.

• Avoid sweeping up dry ash into the air.

• Use water and wet cloth or mop to clean items and surfaces.

	Sleaze, sentiment and stereotypes abound in flashy ‘Miss Saigon’ in SF

		
	Sam Hurwitt, Correspondent
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 12, 2018 at 12:59 pm | UPDATED: October 12, 2018 at 2:03 pm

					Emily Bautista and Anthony Festa star in the touring production of Broadway blockbuster "Miss Saigon," playing at San Francisco's ’ Orpheum Theatre.
				

There’s something grotesque about “Miss Saigon,” the blockbuster musical now playing at San Francisco’s SHN Orpheum Theatre.
Transplanting the plot of Giacomo Puccini’s opera “Madama Butterfly” to war-torn Vietnam, the musical veers back and forth between over-the-top melodramatic tragedy and gleefully excessive comedic sleaze.
Created by the “Les Misérables” team of composer Claude-Michel Schönberg and lyricist and librettist Alain Boublil (with an English-language lyrical assist from Broadway veteran Richard Maltby Jr.), the 1989 musical first came to town at the Orpheum in 1998. SHN has brought the latest tour to San Francisco as part of a series of producer Cameron Mackintosh’s most grandiose hits at the SHN Orpheum Theatre, after “Les Mis” and “The Phantom of the Opera”


“Miss Saigon” comes with a lot of baggage. The original West End and Broadway productions sparked controversy over casting some white actors in prominent Asian roles, and the whole story plays into an insidiously stereotypical narrative, imagining backward Asian people helplessly waiting for white saviors.
It starts in the lurid setting of a Saigon brothel (which somehow seems almost demure compared to the even more raunchy Bangkok red-light-district scene later on), where American soldier Chris has a paid romp in the sack with helpless and desperate virgin Kim, who obsessively waits for him to come take her away with him like he said he’d do, while he gets shipped out back home to the U.S. and moves on with his life. All this is after Kim’s whole village gets slaughtered, mind you.
Solidly played by the orchestra conducted by Will Curry and consistently well sung by the cast, the music is a curious hodgepodge, from forcefully keening laments to catchy if derivative ’70s-style pop, such as the opening number “The Heat Is on in Saigon” (conspicuously reminiscent of Randy Newman’s “Mama Told Me Not to Come”) and syrupy love ballads like “Last Night of the World.” The real showstopper is “The American Dream,” a big old-time Broadway production number delivered by the roguishly sleazy pimp the Engineer, played with devilishly sardonic charm by Red Concepcíon.
Emily Bautista throws herself into the role of the unfortunate Kim with passionate wails, making her sympathetic even if you don’t entirely buy into the story. Anthony Festa’s sullen Chris comes off as more annoyed than amorous despite his earnest lyrics. Stacie Bono is kindly and concerned as Chris’s wife Ellen, and Jinwoo Jung is oddly bland as Kim’s volatile ex-fiancé. J. Daughtry’s prickly and callous John, Chris’s Marine buddy, transforms into a compassionate aid worker in the second act. Four-year-old Fin Moulding is adorably impassive as Kim’s child Tam, alternating in the role with four other kids.
Flashy set designs add to the drama of the storyline in “Miss Saigon” at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco. Matthew Murphy/SHNWhat really sells the musical is all the razzle-dazzle of the production helmed by Laurence Connor, who also directed or co-directed the recent touring productions of “Phantom,” “Les Mis” and “School of Rock” at the Orpheum. The ever-shifting sets are impressive in the production design by Totie Driver and Matt Kinley, from a design concept by the late Adrian Vaux. Andreane Neofitou’s costumes are amusingly flashy in the several brothel scenes.
Because the Engineer’s scenes are so seductively entertaining despite (or partly because of) what a creep he is, ultimately the production is more successful in its moments of lurid excess than in the emotional impact of the melodrama, which makes it feel more like his show than Kim’s. It’s just another way in which the abandoned woman gets a raw deal.

	Thomas Markle’s latest venture? Duchess Meghan’s father may launch men’s clothing line

		
	Martha Ross
	  
	PUBLISHED: August 15, 2018 at 12:17 pm | UPDATED: August 16, 2018 at 4:01 am

					CHESTER, ENGLAND - JUNE 14: Queen Elizabeth II sits with Meghan, Duchess of
Sussex during a ceremony to open the new Mersey Gateway Bridge on June 14,
2018 in the town of Widnes in Halton, Cheshire, England. Meghan Markle
married Prince Harry last month to become The Duchess of Sussex and this is
her first engagement with the Queen. During the visit the pair will open a
road bridge in Widnes and visit The Storyhouse and Town Hall in Chester.

In one of his now infamous Daily Mail interviews, Thomas Markle claimed that he made his daughter, Meghan, the new Duchess of Sussex, “the woman that she is today.”
Maybe the 74-year-old former Hollywood lighting designer thinks that includes preparing former TV actress Meghan to be a global style icon before and after her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry.
So, now that his daughter has become the darling of top international designers and style bloggers, Thomas Markle apparently thinks he should be get into the fashion game himself.


That is if you can believe this bit of news from his oldest daughter Samantha Markle, who, Page Six said, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “So excited about my father’s new #clothing line for men! Will keep you posted!”
This news comes as it was reported in the Sun and other tabloids that Meghan wants to “take a bit of time out” from her father after he claimed in his latest Daily Mail interview that he hung up on Prince Harry after Harry chastised him for working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself before the wedding.

Thomas Markle also took heat on social media Wednesday after people realized that he also either skipped out on — or had not been invited — to his daughter’s first wedding in Jamaica 2011 to film producer Trevor Engelson, Cosmopolitan reported.
So, yes, the timing of Samantha Markle’s announcement about her father’s men’s clothing line is interesting. And whatever could it mean? Is Thomas Markle a closet fashionisto, a man with an eye for sleek, well-tailored suits, or would he prefer to sell more casual items with effortlessly clean shapes and elegant finishes?
Thomas Markle certainly hides his inner sartorialist pretty well.
As the tabloids have shown, Thomas mostly goes out and about in his hometown of Rosarito, Mexico, wearing dark, lose T-shirts and baggy slacks. His usual look earned him the description, “schlubby dad,” at which Thomas Markle took great offense in his latest Mail on Sunday interview over the weekend.
“I’m not ‘the weirdo schlubby dad living in a shack in Mexico drinking beer and eating McDonald’s,” he told the Mail. “I get take-out fish from McDonald’s. I’ve lost 40 pounds since my heart attack. I eat fish and vegetables and stay on a 2,000 calorie-a-day diet.”
Perhaps Thomas Markle’s new health regimen has inspired him to embrace a new interest in how he looks, and now he wants to share this interest with other men. Maybe his fashion line will be for guys like himself who get the “schlubby” label.
Of course, this news about Thomas Markle’s clothing line doesn’t come from the most reliable of sources. His daughter Samantha Markle has tried to grab her share of the spotlight by criticizing her younger half-sister Meghan on social media and in interviews for being a “Princess Pushy” social climber. Samantha Markle, who is also known as Samantha Grant, has parlayed this strange sort of fame into a reality TV gig on the U.K.’s “Celebrity Big Brother,” according to Metro.
But if it is true that Thomas Markle has such sartorial aims, it wouldn’t be fair for anyone to assume that he lacks any aesthetic sensibility. After all, he made his career in Hollywood as a lightning designer for TV shows, including “General Hospital and “Married with Children.” He was nominated multiple times for Emmy Awards, and won once, for his design work on “General Hospital.”
Thomas Markle also claimed in another Mail on Sunday interview that his lighting design work helped him put his daughter Meghan through private school in Los Angeles and through Northwestern University.
So, maybe there is something to the idea that Thomas Markle helped his daughter develop her own fashion sense, encouraging the creativity and flexibility she needed to go from a Bohemian-chic TV actress to an elegantly-attired royal family member who regularly keeps company with Queen Elizabeth II.
Also, one can’t forget that one of Thomas Markle’s most famous moments of the past few months is when he worked with the paparazzi to stage those photos, including one showing him in a tuxedo rental shop, getting fitted for a suit.
The photo created a scandal right before the wedding, which, coupled with Thomas Markle’s health crisis and heart surgery, prompted him to pull out of traveling to the U.K. to walk his daughter down the aisle.
But if nothing else, Markle’s staged shot also shows he has a keen understanding of the need for a well-fitted ensemble, taking up the dictum from Shakespeare and others that “clothes make the man.”

CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Jodi Lyn O’Keefe, 40; Mario Lopez, 45; Wendi McLendon-Covey, 49; Nora Roberts, 68.



Happy Birthday: Some of the people around you will undergo changes that leave you wondering what you should do next. Instability is a sign that change needs to take place, but what and how you alter your life will be crucial this year. Take your time, even if someone tries to pressure you to decide prematurely. Do what’s best for yourself. Your numbers are 4, 9, 14, 25, 32, 38, 49. 



ARIES (March 21-April 19): Just do it. Don’t hesitate or let your responsibilities hang over your head. Take the initiative and clear the air of any baggage you carry. Once you are free and clear of excess dead weight, you’ll feel less stressed and increasingly motivated. 3 stars 



TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Time is on your side. Consider all your options and plan your actions carefully. You have plenty to gain if you follow your heart and do what you know is best for yourself. Don’t let anyone goad you into an argument. 3 stars 



GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Touch base with people you find inspiring. Working alongside people who get things done will give you the boost you need to take care of some of your own unfinished business. The relief you feel will be worth the effort. 3 stars 



CANCER (June 21-July 22): Plan something special. Get involved in events you care about. Mingle with people who can make a difference in your life. Partnerships look promising, and love and romance are encouraged. Family planning will lead to a feeling of belonging and greater togetherness. 5 stars 

 

LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Overreacting will only hold you back and end up costing you. Accepting what you cannot change will help you work with, not against, the powers that be. Use your ingenuity, and you’ll come up with a way to overcome adversity. 2 stars 



VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): A business trip or hanging out with someone you haven’t seen for a long time will help you figure out what you should do next. It’s OK to dream and strive to acquire what will make you happy. Share your intentions. 4 stars 



					
				

LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Put more creativity into whatever you do. How you handle situations and people will make a difference in the outcome of a situation you face at work or at home. Listen, and respond with suggestions and the willingness to compromise. 3 stars 



SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Take a deep breath and prepare to implement change. Don’t get frazzled if others don’t pitch in and help. If you believe in what you are doing, follow through with passion and precision. Eventually you’ll gain support and respect. 3 stars 



SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Listen to advice, but when it comes time to decide, be cognizant of what’s truly to your benefit and what someone else may have suggested for his or her personal benefit. Act on your own behalf. 3 stars



CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Take pride in what you do. It’s OK to be unique and to show off what you have to offer. Do your own thing, and be proud of your accomplishments. An important relationship will undergo a positive transformation. 4 stars 



AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Don’t be swayed by what someone else is saying or doing. Walk away from excessive or indulgent people. Sit tight until you feel you are in a better position to make positive change. Focus on personal growth. 2 stars 



PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Look for a different route if you feel you are being blocked. Use your ingenuity to turn something you want to pursue into a going concern. Love, money, lucrative contracts and better health can be yours if you make the right choices. 5 stars

By Erin Baldassari | ebaldassari@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: June 17, 2018 at 3:43 pm | UPDATED: June 18, 2018 at 8:04 am


OAKLAND — In Tigrinya, the language of Hager Seven Asefaha’s native Eritrea, “Alena” literally means, “We are here.”

It was with this sense of place and purpose that Asefaha founded the Alena Museum in 2015 inside a West Oakland warehouse he was renting — largely in response to the booming real estate market that was raising rents, and continues to do so, throughout the city, forcing scores of artists, and in particular, artists of color, to leave Oakland. But, the nonprofit museum’s mission is already being tested as it faces an eviction battle of its own.

The museum was supposed to be a refuge for African diaspora artists of many disciplines, who were already unmoored from their cultural roots, to cultivate their art and grow their businesses. It took on added significance in the face of the ballooning Oakland real estate market and became home to a rehearsal space for an Afro-Brazilian dance troop, art classes for kids, an art gallery and photography studio, among other uses. Other nonprofits also operate out of the warehouse, including The People’s Kitchen Collective, which fed hundreds of people last month during a large outdoor community event that was part celebration and part protest.

“The vision was to develop this nonprofit that would house the black diaspora in the middle of this cultural migration or exodus that was happening,” Asefaha said. “It was really to hold space for marginalized communities in Oakland as we saw the city change around us.”

But after five years of renting from Lynne Glassman, a retired San Francisco resident who ran a Mercedes wrecking and auto service business in West Oakland for 17 years, Glassman has chosen not to renew the lease. Asefaha contends he’s being unfairly blamed for a shooting that occurred outside the gallery earlier this year, while Glassman argues Asefaha never communicated his intentions of operating an art gallery and event space out of the warehouse.

Glassman pointed to the Ghost Ship fire, which ripped through a warehouse in Oakland’s Fruitvale neighborhood in December 2016, killing 36 people at a dance party, and said he was concerned the space wasn’t being properly managed. There were rooftop parties he didn’t know about until after the fact, the shooting on Feb. 24 that wounded one man, and complaints from neighbors, he said. Asefaha denies the allegations.

“(Asefaha) has accused me of being racist and that’s just far from the truth,” Glassman said. “I’m not at all bigoted. I wish him well. I just don’t want to have any extensions of his lease.”

Oda/Bay Area News Group) 
Glassman and Asefaha were renegotiating Asefaha’s five-year lease when the shooting occurred, they said. Asefaha had agreed to pay a $2,400 hike to his $3,600-per-month rent.

Police at the time of the shooting told Glassman it was related to the party at the museum, Glassman said. But Asefaha said the shooting happened before his event even started.

					
				

The complaints from neighbors began earlier this year, as well, Glassman said, though the city’s database does not show any record of them. And, Asefaha said he’s never thrown any rooftop parties.

Asefaha did apply for permits in 2015 and 2016 to operate an art gallery inside the warehouse and to use it for custom manufacturing to make art, both of which the city approved. But, Glassman said Asefaha never checked with him before doing so, and he wasn’t aware that was happening, though he had visited the warehouse on several occasions over the years. The permits didn’t require the landlord to sign off on them, Asefaha said.

“I never saw any activity there,” Glassman said. “Whenever I saw him, I didn’t see anything I didn’t approve of.”

Hager Asefaha, known in the artist community as Seven, takes a break from setting up the art space for an event at the Alena Museum in Oakland, Calif., on Friday, June 15, 2018.

Oda/Bay Area News Group) 
The disagreement has gotten contentious, and a bit personal for Glassman, he said, so he’s ready to move past it. What that means for Asefaha and the Alena Museum is less clear. They’ve retained James Cook, an Oakland attorney, to fight the court order demanding they vacate the space.

Since Asefaha lives there, along with two other housemates, Cook contends Glassman’s eviction order is inadequate. Glassman can’t simply kick out the Alena Museum as a business, he must evict each tenant individually and show just cause for doing so, per Oakland’s rental laws, Cook said.

On a recent Sunday, Asefaha was optimistic the museum would be able to either find a new space or would be able to continue the museum’s mission in other ways. The Community Arts Stabilization Trust (CAST) has given the museum two grants for consulting services, including one in early 2017 to help with long-term planning and another this year to help the museum solidify its business plan — though Asefaha said they won’t likely be able to take advantage of the latter grant until they know the fate of their building.

Cook said the legal dispute will likely go to trial in the next month or two.

Even if the Alena Museum doesn’t get to stay in West Oakland, Asefaha hopes its experience will inspire others to continue pushing back against displacement — for residents, other businesses and, especially, artists of color.

“We’re one of many in Oakland facing displacement,” Asefaha said. “You can’t just heartlessly push communities out. There’s a certain level of responsibility (landlords) have to the community they invest into to do right by them.”

Firefighters raced from street to street late Thursday in Lake Elsinore neighborhoods, successfully fighting back flames as winds pushed the expanding Holy fire perilously close to homes.

UPDATE: Holy fire on Friday grows to more than 18,000 acres

The blaze, possibly sparked by an arsonist Monday, has raced through more than 10,000 acres of thick brush and timber in Orange and Riverside counties, prompting evacuations, closing roads and shuttering some local schools while fouling the air and casting ominous clouds of dark smoke over the region.

In Lake Elsinore, the battle Thursday moved along several streets – Sandpiper Drive, Crystal Ridge Court, Edgewood Drive, N. Crest Drive, Lincoln Street, Dale Court and McVicker Canyon Park Road, for a few.

Some 700 firefighters, fire engines and aircraft dropping retardant and water took on the streets. The trucks parked in driveways, and crews ran hoses into backyards to fight off walls of flames climbing up hillsides.

Don Sperline, 64, a resident of Crystal Ridge Court, watched as firefighters repelled the flames.

“It was like a blast furnace when it came,” he said.

Homes weren’t all that were defended

The afternoon fire burned near Rice Canyon Elementary and even the McVicker Park Fire Station as well as adjacent McVicker Park used as a staging Area for law-enforcement and firefighters.

					
				

All were spared.

No homes were reported damaged by flames Thursday. Twelve structures, higher up in the mountains, have burned since the fire started Monday.

Thanh Nguyen, a spokesman for Holy incident commanders, credited the teamwork of meteorologists, fire-behavior analysts and firefighters for saving the homes.

“The bottom line is, we anticipated it. They got ahead of it,” Nguyen said.

The blaze grew to 10,236 acres Thursday and containment remained at 5 percent. Containment is the percentage of the fire’s perimeter that firefighters have determined the blaze will no long spread beyond.

Above the neighborhoods, hand crews climbed steep terrain like herds of mountain goats to dig fire breaks. But high winds caused embers to start new fires. Those winds are the result of thunderstorms outside the fire area.

Those thunderstorms brought erratic winds Thursday that pushed flames in unpredictable directions. Those same storms are expected this weekend to bring the promise of higher humidity — a weather condition that should help slow the flames, Nguyen said.

A difficult firefight was expected Thursday night and Friday, Nguyen said, as flames continue to move downhill on three different fronts, into Horsethief Canyon, McVickers Canyon and El Cariso Village. McVickers, where the fire was especially aggressive Thursday, will be a point of emphasis Friday.

New mandatory evacuations were ordered Thursday afternoon.

Just after 2 p.m., the Cleveland National Forest ordered residents of the mountainside of Lake Street, as well as those living in the area southwest of the area spanning Grand Avenue to Ortega Highway, to evacuate.

At 3:30 p.m., voluntary evacuations were announced for the Shoreline community.

Just after 5 p.m., the Lake Street offramps on the 15 Freeway were closed.

Also Thursday, Gov. Brown declared a state of emergency in Riverside and Orange counties, a proclamation that will allow them to receive disaster assistance from the state. The order also waives fees for replacing vehicle records such as licenses and registrations destroyed by fire, and it eliminates the one-week waiting period for applying for unemployment benefits for those who have lost their job because of the fire.

The flames and poor air quality prompted several Riverside County school districts to close schools Thursday; some will also be closed on Friday.

“(O)ut of an abundance of caution, and because of mandatory evacuations in specific neighborhoods affected by the Holy fire, the following Lake Elsinore Unified School District schools will be closed until further notice: Luiseño School, Rice Canyon Elementary, Terra Cotta Middle School, and Withrow Elementary,” the district said on its website.

All of the schools in the Perris Elementary School District, the Perris Union High School District,  the Menifee Union School District, and the Romoland School District, as well as Santa Rosa Academy, closed Thursday. The Menifee district said its schools would also be closed Friday. All Menifee elementary school back-to-school nights have been rescheduled to Aug. 23.

Thursday was slated to be Romoland’s first day of school.

Neighborhoods evacuated

Voluntary evacuation orders were issued for the community of Machado near Lake Elsinore, according to a Twitter post from the Cleveland National Forest.

The Holy fire, named for its ignition point in Holy Jim Canyon, has prompted authorities to issue mandatory evacuation orders for the Lake Elsinore-area communities of:

	McVickers Canyon
	Rice Canyon
	Horsethief Canyon
	Glen Eden
	El Cariso Village
	Sycamore Creek
	Rancho Capistrano
	Holy Jim Canyon
	Trabuco Canyon
	The Ortega Highway corridor from the Grand Avenue in Riverside County to Nichols Institute in Orange County


Despite the evacuation orders, several people in the Lake Elsinore communities remained home watching the flames as they came closer.



Former firefighter Josh Keifer, 36, remained at his home but packed his trailer and said he was ready to leave at a moment’s notice.

He said he is a former U. S. Forest Service firefighter and his assignments included the Cleveland National Forest — the area burning over the back of his house.

“I’ve done structure protection. I know what to do and I know when to get out,” he said. His fifth-wheeler parked in front of his home was hooked up and ready to go.

“I know the terrain pretty well. I just did it for so long — you just never forget,” Kiefer said.

The fire had burned down to the red line of retardant dropped Wednesday to protect the area.

“It will burn,” Kiefer said of the retardant-coated brush and oak trees. “But it just takes longer to start. The embers are what you have to worry about — they can blow a mile-and-half.”

In the evacuated McVicker Canyon Park neighborhood in Lake Elsinore, Joe Rodriguez, 38, decided to stay put in his home, which backs up against the burning hillside. “Until that thing is barking at my door, I’m going to stick with it,” he said.

Rodriguez said he is an experienced hang glider pilot familiar with the area’s fire country. “I fly over this 300 hours a year.”

He also said the line of fire retardant dropped on the hill above his house has so far checked the fire’s advance – aided by a helicopter water drop earlier Thursday morning.

Rodriguez said his wife and two daughters have evacuated. On Thursday morning he was going over his patio with a power washer – not for fire prevention but to wash off the fire retardant before it stained.

Fire authorities have advised against residents waiting until the last minute to evacuate because it could cause traffic concerns especially in neighborhoods with winding and narrow roads. Tips on making an evacuation plan are available at ReadyForWildfire.org.

As residents are trying to flee, larger fire trucks could be trying to get in causing congestion.

Skydiving planes rerouted

It was mostly business as usual Thursday at Skydive Elsinore. Daniella Martin, the operations manager, refuted claims made on social media that skydivers were interfering with aerial firefighting operations.

The airfield is south of the lake, whereas the fire is burning to the north. Planes that normally would take off to the north are now launching to the south because of the fire, Martin said. She added that she heard from fire officials Thursday thanking Skydive Elsinore for its cooperation.

But some callers to the facility have been cursing at office staff and claiming that the skydivers “are as bad as the arsonist,” Martin said.

Nguyen, the incident commanders’ spokesman, said the presence of skydivers was “a non-issue.”

Also Thursday, Lake Elsinore Mayor Natasha Johnson sought to dispel what she said were rumors of robbery and looting in the evacuation areas.

“I personally was in a patrol car from 9:45 p.m. until almost 2 a.m. (Thursday) morning. There were a few calls for reported burglaries, all unfounded,” she wrote on her Facebook page, Natasha Johnson Lake Elsinore Mayor. “According to our sheriff’s department, this morning I have confirmed no arrests were made in any of the evacuation areas.”





The Sheriff’s Department confirmed that there has been no looting and that it has increased its presence in the neighborhoods.


Per @RSO there is no looting occurring in the City of #LakeElsinore. There is an increase in patrol at this time. #HolyFire pic.twitter.com/RZrbBcPgbC

Unusual fire behavior

More than five decades ago, firefighters gave the unusual fire behavior in the area a name: the Elsinore effect, which explains why flames of the Holy Fire are burning downhill from Orange County. This phenomenon was explained in a report titled “The dynamics of catastrophe — the Decker wildland fire of 1959.“

Flames tend to burn quickly uphill, but not downhill. Not so in Lake Elsinore, according to the report. Marine air from the Pacific Ocean flows east over the Santa Ana Mountains and down through the northeast-facing canyons and drainage basins, pushing flames downhill. This movement of air typically ends around sundown as areas to the east cool, causing the flames to reverse direction and begin to burn back uphill.

The report described ferocious firestorms in Lake Elsinore that killed six firefighters and injured about 45 more out of a firefighting force of 500 in the 1959 fire.

	Studies: Aspirin not cure-all for avoiding first heart attack, stroke

					Most people won't benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin or fish oil supplements to prevent a first heart attack or stroke, a study revealed. Results were discussed Sunday, Aug. 26, 2018, at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Munich.
				


By MARILYNN MARCHIONE
Taking a low-dose aspirin every day has long been known to cut the chances of another heart attack, stroke or other heart problem in people who already have had one, but the risks aren’t worth it for most folks, major new research finds.


Although it’s been used for more than a century, aspirin’s value in many situations is still unclear. The latest studies are some of the largest and longest to test this pennies-a-day blood thinner in people who don’t yet have heart disease or a blood vessel-related problem.

One found that aspirin did not help prevent first strokes or heart attacks in people at moderate risk for one because they had several health threats such as smoking, high blood pressure or high cholesterol.
Another tested aspirin in people with diabetes, who are more likely to develop or die from heart problems, and found that the modest benefit it gave was offset by a greater risk of serious bleeding.
Aspirin did not help prevent cancer as had been hoped.
And fish oil supplements, also tested in the study of people with diabetes, failed to help.
“There’s been a lot of uncertainty among doctors around the world about prescribing aspirin” beyond those for whom it’s now recommended, said one study leader, Dr. Jane Armitage of the University of Oxford in England. “If you’re healthy, it’s probably not worth taking it.”
The research was discussed Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Munich. The aspirin studies used 100 milligrams a day, more than the 81-milligram pills commonly sold in the United States but still considered low dose. Adult strength is 325 milligrams.
WHO’S REALLY AT RISK?
A Boston-led study gave aspirin or dummy pills to 12,546 people who were thought to have a moderate risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within a decade because of other health issues.
After five years, 4 percent of each group had suffered a heart problem — far fewer than expected, suggesting these people were actually at low risk, not moderate. Other medicines they were taking to lower blood pressure and cholesterol may have cut their heart risk so much that aspirin had little chance of helping more, said the study leader, Dr. J. Michael Gaziano of Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
One percent of aspirin takers had stomach or intestinal bleeding, mostly mild— twice as many as those on dummy pills. Aspirin users also had more nosebleeds, indigestion, reflux or belly pain.
Bayer sponsored the study, and many researchers consult for the aspirin maker. Results were published by the journal Lancet.
ASPIRIN FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES?
People with diabetes have a higher risk of heart problems and strokes from a blood clot, but also a higher risk of bleeding. Guidelines vary on which of them should consider aspirin.
Oxford researchers randomly assigned 15,480 adults with Type 1 or 2 diabetes but otherwise in good health and with no history of heart problems to take either aspirin, 1 gram of fish oil, both substances, or dummy pills every day.
After seven and a half years, there were fewer heart problems among aspirin users but more cases of serious bleeding, so they largely traded one risk for another.
FISH OIL RESULTS
The same study also tested omega-3 fatty acids, the good oils found in salmon, tuna and other fish. Supplement takers fared no better than those given dummy capsules — 9 percent of each group suffered a heart problem.
“We feel very confident that there doesn’t seem to be a role for fish oil supplements for preventing heart disease,” said study leader Dr. Louise Bowman of the University of Oxford.

The British Heart Foundation was the study’s main sponsor. Bayer and Mylan provided aspirin and fish oil, respectively. Results were published by the New England Journal of Medicine.Other studies are testing different amounts and prescription versions of fish oil, “but I can’t tell people to go spend your money on it; we think it’s probably better to eat fish,” said Dr. Holly Andersen, a heart disease prevention specialist at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell who was not involved in the study.
The new research doesn’t alter guidelines on aspirin or fish oil, said Dr. Nieca Goldberg, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Medical Center and an American Heart Association spokeswoman. They recommend fish oil only for certain heart failure patients and say it’s reasonable to consider for people who have already suffered a heart attack.

SARATOGA — Kerri Walsh Jennings doesn’t have a beach volleyball partner with qualifying for the 2020 Tokyo Games beginning next month.

What, her worry?

“Even though today I don’t have a partner and all this stuff is going on, I have no doubt that, A) I will qualify and B) we will win,” Walsh Jennings said at the South Bay home where she grew up. 

The volleyball great from Stanford and Archbishop Mitty High has narrowed her candidates to two women. She declined to name them but it’s not difficult to guess what Walsh Jennings is after since splitting last month with veteran Nicole Branagh of Orinda.

The three-time Olympic champion tried to unite with the sport’s most promising young player last year after separating from Rio Games’ partner April Ross. But Walsh Jennings couldn’t persuade 5-foot-10 Sara Hughes to join her in pursuit of a sixth Summer Olympics appearance.

Hughes, 23, won rookie of the year on the international volleyball circuit in 2017 after graduating from USC with four consecutive national collegiate titles. She and partner Summer Ross (no relation to April Ross) currently are tour’s the top-ranked Americans.

Walsh Jennings said the two couldn’t connect because of bad timing when recruiting Hughes during her final NCAA championship.

“I felt like such a jerk imposing,” Walsh Jennings said. “She said let’s talk after the championship. At some point, Sara and I had to move on. She’s not one of the two I’m thinking about.”

Who the new partner might be is one of the big questions on the sand. Walsh Jennings wants someone like Hughes who is young and can do more than just block and hit.

					
				

The United States can send two teams to the Summer Olympics, which will end six days before Walsh Jennings turns 42. 

The mother of three plans to retire after Tokyo, adding to her internal pressure to qualify.  But Walsh Jennings won’t rush the decision to find a partner.

“I would rather do it right than force it,” she said. “They take the 12 best finishes over two years now.”

In the interim, the Manhattan Beach star will play with Carolina Solberg of Brazil in at least two of the four upcoming tournaments in her new venture called p1440. The inaugural tournament, music festival and health-and-wellness exposition is scheduled Sept. 28-30 at Avaya Stadium. (For tickets, check www.eventbrite.com/e/p1440-san-jose-tickets-47330053464). 

She toured the Bay Area last week to promote the launching of a series that includes a stop in Las Vegas on Oct. 19-21. The Vegas event has been earmarked as an Olympic qualifier by the international volleyball federation (FIVB).   

The search for an Olympic partner began at the end of July after Walsh Jennings and Branagh split for the second time in six years. The team had reached the quarterfinals in only two of the  10 FIVB tournaments they appeared.

“It’s not because of her, it’s because of us together — we weren’t great,” Walsh Jennings said. “Our timing wasn’t great together. We weren’t scoring enough points and we should be dominant. We really should be and we weren’t.”

Walsh Jennings had surgeries on a shoulder and ankle in the past year. But perhaps the problem was players’ similarities in age and height. Branagh, 39, is 6-2. Walsh Jennings, who turns 40 a week from Wednesday, is 6-3.  
“If I’m going to Tokyo I’m going to put myself in the best position for success,” said the player who won a bronze medal in Rio.

Now the question is who will join her.

By Associated Press | 
PUBLISHED: July 15, 2018 at 9:44 pm | UPDATED: July 16, 2018 at 3:49 am


By GRAHAM DUNBAR

MOSCOW (AP) — Taking turns sliding across the rain-soaked turf holding the World Cup trophy tight, teenager Kylian Mbappe and the rest of France’s players acted like the youthful bunch they are.

Nothing, not a Pussy Riot protest nor a postgame downpour that soaked Russian President Vladimir Putin, was going to stop the party.

It carried on long after a thrilling 4-2 win over Croatia on Sunday. In the locker room with French President Emmanuel Macron striking poses with players, then a champagne-spraying, water-splashing interruption of the coach Didier Deschamps’ news conference.

“Sorry! They’re young and they’re happy,” said Deschamps, like a proud father.

Deschamps had good reason to indulge them. His team is mostly aged 25 or under and can return almost intact to defend their title in 2022 in Qatar.

“Our children are going to be very proud,” forward Antoine Griezmann said. “The World Cup, it’s a lot.”

The 19-year-old Mbappe became only the second teen after Pele to score in a World Cup final.

Mbappe had just shown his electrifying speed in the 52nd minute when play was held up by four protesters who ran onto the field. Russian punk band Pussy Riot later took credit for the incident — watched from the VIP seats by Putin, whose government once jailed members of the activist group. Charges were filed against the group Sunday, too.

					
				

Putin was later on the field to award medals to the players in a ceremony soon drenched in rain and joy. As thunder pealed and lightning cracked, FIFA president Gianni Infantino handed France captain Hugo Lloris the gold World Cup trophy.

Gold confetti stuck to the soaked Les Bleus as they paraded the trophy around the Luzhniki Stadium, a final act of an enthralling tournament in which Croatia reached its first final while powers Brazil, Germany and Argentina went home early.

About 12 minutes after a protester gave Mbappe a double high-five on the field, Mbappe sent a right-footed shot from 25 yards (meters) past goalkeeper Danijel Subasic . The goal put France up 4-1, closing the door on Croatia who had been the better team until Mbappe took control.

The only other teen to score in a World Cup final was Pele, who was 17 when Brazil beat Sweden 5-2 in 1958.

Mbappe, who plays for Paris Saint-Germain in the French league, was born months after France won its only other World Cup title in 1998.

“I have a whole story to write,” Mbappe said. “This is just the beginning.”

Paul Pogba and Griezmann, France’s two other key creative players, also scored. Pogba played a disciplined role in Russia, but his natural joy was evident celebrating his 18-yard (meter) shot, and leading the champagne shower for Deschamps.

But it was Mbappe who put the match out of reach with a furious passage of play in the second half. In the 59th, a run from Mbappe started a play that ended up with Pogba on the edge of the penalty area. With his second attempt, the midfielder curled his shot beyond Subasic.

Griezmann scored from the penalty spot in the 38th minute fully four minutes after his corner kick was knocked out of play by Ivan Perisic’s arm. The referee ruled it handball only after a video review, just as the first thunders claps boomed around the stadium.

“In a World Cup final, you do not give such a penalty,” Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic said.

France took the lead in the 18th when Croatia’s tallest outfield player, 1.90-meter (6-foot-3) forward Mario Mandzukic, rose to meet Griezmann’s free kick with the top of his head. He deflected it past his own goalkeeper.

Perisic and Mandzukic both scored for Croatia, first to equalize in the 28th minute and later as a consolation goal in the 69th, embarrassing Lloris with a flicked shot as the France goalkeeper tried to dribble the ball out of his goalmouth.

But the three-goal lead was too much for the red-and-white-checkered squad that made a habit of coming back at the World Cup — and played three straight 120-minute games before the final.

“We were dominant, we had control,” Dalic said through a translator. “What we’ve had in terms of luck over the tournament, we lacked that today.”

Deschamps became only the third man to win the World Cup as a player and a coach. He joined Mario Zagallo of Brazil and Franz Beckenbauer, who captained West Germany.

France’s captain 20 years ago, Deschamps was lifted up by his players on the field and flung into the air several teams and caught. The normally staid coach did a few skipping dance steps in the rain before stopping and laughing at himself.

It was that kind of unbridled evening for the French who won with an exuberance not often seen in a mostly efficient, controlled title run.

Back home in France, tens of thousands of fans headed to the Eiffel Tower to watch a broadcast on giant screens that Paris police closed the area more than two hours before kickoff.

Two years ago at home, France flopped in a European Championship final it was expected to win against Portugal.

“But maybe if we had been European champions we would not be champions today,” Deschamps said.

PRESIDENTS’ CLUB

Putin watched the game in a VIP section with the presidents of France and Croatia, Emmanuel Macron and Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic.

Macron paced nervously out of his seat during the video review, and kissed his Croatian counterpart on both cheeks to console her after the game. They joined the medal ceremony and both kissed the gold trophy before it got to Lloris.

FINAL GOALS

The two previous finals were 0-0 after 90 minutes before being settled with a single goal deep into extra time.

Three goals in the first half was the most prolific since 1974, when West Germany went into the break up 2-1 against the Netherlands. That was the final score.

The six-goal final was the most since England beat West Germany 4-2 in 1966. It also ensured the 2018 World Cup had only one scoreless game, when France last played at Luzhniki Stadium against Denmark.

	Hotline newsletter: What the officiating scandal says about the Pac-12 (and how can the conference recover?)

		
	Jon Wilner
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 12, 2018 at 11:00 am | UPDATED: October 13, 2018 at 12:51 pm

	  
		Categories:
		College Sports, Sports	



	* The Pac-12 Hotline newsletter is published each Monday-Wednesday-Friday during the college sports season (and twice-a-week in the summer). This edition, from Oct. 12, has been made available in archived form …


ThirdPartyGate: The aftermath
Nothing much has happened since the last newsletter, on Wednesday morning. Nope, nothing much at all ..
Where should we begin with the latest controversy to rock Pac-12 football? I’ll assume most readers are familiar with the Yahoo exclusive — and that some are familiar with the subsequent Hotline analysis — and start this commentary at the end.


With four takeaways:
1. I’ll admit to being unsure how commissioner Larry Scott would respond — the conference office doesn’t always see things the way they appear on the front lines — but he was swift and decisive in:
Accepting responsibility: “I’ve come to the conclusion we made a mistake in terms of our procedures with replay review. We mixed administrative oversight and leadership with real-time replay reviews.”
Acknowledging the integrity of the process was jeopardized: “Moreover, we’ve allowed for ambiguity about who’s got the final call and who makes the ultimate decisions in replay review.”
Taking corrective action: The conference will conduct a long-term review of its replay procedure; in the short term, general counsel and lead football administrator Woodie Dixon has been removed from the replay review process. (Scott had no choice on that matter.)
2. That the conference found itself in this giant, stinkin’ mess in the first place is inexcusable.
During his remarks Thursday morning at Pac-12 basketball media day, Scott explained Dixon’s role in the process: “He has been involved in support for our replay officials and discussion about replay decisions. … Upon reflection, I think that was a mistake.”
Upon reflection?
For each and every conference stakeholder, from the fans and coaches to the TV partners and school presidents, that should be the most concerning aspect:
The Pac-12 actually considered it appropriate for a conference executive … for the boss of the boss of the officials, who is not trained as an official … to participate in the review process.
To get the calls right, to achieve consistency, to ensure integrity, the officiating process must be sacred ground. Anybody who knows anything about football knows that.
If this were the conference’s first misstep, the scandal wouldn’t have packed the PR wallop it did. (More on that below, in ‘State of Affairs.’) But when it comes to football matters, the Pac-12 continues to get in its own way.
Someone should have known Dixon cannot be part of the review process.
Someone should have known it’s a bad idea for Scott to speak publicly about specific calls.
Someone should have known it’s not a good idea to play a Friday road game after a Saturday road game.
Yet time and again, no one does know.
All this stuff … it damages the brand.
And you know who suffers? The schools.
3. Scott was asked if he had reason to believe Dixon had influenced the review process on prior occasions.
“I’m not aware of any other incident where our replay officials have had a concern,” he said.
In that vein, allow the Hotline to pose this question: Is it possible that Dixon’s action influenced a sequence that came later — for instance: same game, one quarter later.
I was dumbfounded that the replay officials didn’t stop play to take a close look at Porter Gustin’s collision with Gardner Minshew on Washington State’s final drive. It was a clear case of targeting and would have put the Cougars in position for the winning touchdown.
But on the field, in the booth and in the command center, there was silence. No penalty, no stoppage, no nothing. It made no sense, unless …
The official in the replay booth had just been told by his boss’ boss that what he thought was targeting by WSU’s Logan Tago on JT Daniels was not, in fact, a penalty. In that case, when the next instance arises, why bother, right?
Either that, or the officials knew a mistake had been made with the Tago ruling and didn’t penalize Gustin because they wanted to even it out.
In my mind, those are the most likely explanations for the Gustin non-call that, depending on events, could have a momentous impact on the North race.
4. From here, where?
The changes implemented by Scott are merely the first step in restoring the credibility of an entity (Pac-12 officiating) that didn’t have much in the first place.
Were this the first instance, a swift recovery might be possible. But the conference has experienced so many significant problems with officiating — not only with the calls on the field and in the booth but with the process itself in both major sports (think: Ed Rush and Sean Miller) — that this later dumpster fire will smolder for the rest of the season, into next year and perhaps beyond.
Scott says he cares about integrity and accuracy in the officiating process. We shall see. — Jon Wilner.


Hot off the Hotline

• For all its off-the-court woes, Pac-12 basketball is poised for a rebound in 2018-19 because of the combination of returning and incoming talent across the majority of rosters.
• Week Seven brings two division-defining games: Colorado-USC in the South and Washington-Oregon in the North. For different reasons, the Hotline likes the favorites.
• Is Laviska Shenault a legitimate Heisman contender? We spoke to an expert on the topic, the man who wrote the book on the award, about the likelihood of a little-known receiver from a second-tier program reaching New York for the ceremony.
• I’m pleased to announce the newsletter is now available in archival form in its entirety (all the links to Hotline content and articles from other sources). Previous editions will be posted regularly. Here’s the hashtag: https://www.mercurynews.com/tag/pac-12-hotline-newsletter/
Why we need your support: Like so many other providers of local journalism across the country, the Hotline’s parent website, mercurynews.com, recently moved to a subscription model. A few Hotline stories will remain free each month (as will this newsletter), but for access to all content, you’ll need to subscribe at a rate of just 12 cents per day for 12 months. And thanks for your loyalty.


State of Affairs I
Perspective on the conference from beyond its borders …
• Yahoo national columnist Pat Forde offered a brutal but spot-on takedown of the Pac-12. This is only a sliver: “It’s so bad off the field that nobody is even talking about the league’s swooning football product, 21-year streak without a basketball national title or the Pac-12 Network distribution debacle. That’s a lot of lousy on the plate of the guy who has been the highest-paid commissioner in college athletics. (Larry) Scott made $4.8 million in 2016, according to a USA Today report from May. Not only that, but nine other Pac-12 staffers made more than $450,000 in 2016, USA Today reported. The league is trailing well behind its conference competition in revenue and revenue-sport performance. But not in salaries for execs.”


State of Affairs II and III
Because the national media narrative matters …
• The Athletic’s Bruce Feldman sought feedback on the officiating scandal from coaches and administrators from around the country: “The long-time Power 5 coach we spoke to early Thursday morning said he thinks these officiating issues stem from an environment fostered by Scott focusing more on being ‘innovative’ than having the best interest of college athletics and their fans at heart.” (Note: subscription site.) … Meanwhile, CBS Sports columnist Dennis Dodd views the officiating scandal through the lens of player safety: “To the Pac-12, the issue is not whether (JT) Daniels was ding-donged back to the Stone Age by Logan Tago, it was about closing administrative loopholes.”


In the news

(Note: The Hotline newsletter includes links to sites that could require a subscription once the number of free views has been reached.)
• All signs point to Utah beating Arizona tonight, save the fact that Utah often struggles to beat Arizona.
• From the rivalry that gave us The Pick, we now have The Finger. (Who’s writing the Oregon-Washington scripts, Seinfeld?)
• How might the North and South showdowns affect the Pac-12’s playoff chances? ESPN’s Heather Dinich, who covers the CFP as a beat, assesses the possible outcomes.
• I agree with this: Oregon’s defense vs. Washington’s offense is the key matchup in Eugene, not Justin Herbert vs. the UW secondary.
• In the South, USC has a singular focus, and its name is Shenault.
• Is Stanford’s playcalling too predictable, too conservative? Reasonable questions. Coach David Shaw says he’s aiming for balance.
• If Cal loses to UCLA, the road to the postseason turns treacherous.
• Nebraska is concerned about its roster getting raided … by Oregon State. “I hope this kind of stuff keeps happening,” writes Oregonian columnist John Canzano.


On the Hardwood
• The return of Jaylen Hands and Kris Wilkes, one of the top perimeter tandems in the conference, makes UCLA a preseason favorite.
• The trick for Washington coach Mike Hopkins? Managing expectations.
• Utah is just fine toiling away from the spotlight, as the arrow instead of the target.
• Arizona coach Sean Miller, after deflecting questions about the basketball scandal, said he was surprised the bar has been set so high for his rebuilt Wildcats.


Parlay Card
If wagering is good enough for the Supreme Court, it’s good enough for the Hotline …
• Utah should have the best defense on the field tonight in Salt Lake City, but Arizona’s isn’t half bad. That should allow the Wildcats to cover the 14-point spread, according to Sports Illustrated’s preview.
• Oregon can stand up to Washington on the lines of scrimmage and has the better quarterback, so take the points, says CBS Sports gambling columnist Tom Fornelli, who likes Oregon to win outright.
• Colorado is 4-1 against the spread in its past five while USC is 1-7 in its last eight, per oddsshark. (In truth, the under might be the best play with the Trojans and Buffs.)


Choice Reads

• Boss Tagaloa has returned from suspension to revitalize UCLA’s running game, thanks in part to advice from his father: “Is this going to be a tombstone or is it going to be another steppingstone for a learning curve in life?” The L.A. Times’ Ben Bolch with the account.
• Mario Cristobal has Oregon ahead of schedule, writes Sports Illustrated’s Andy Staples, by employing a different approach: “Cristobal would love nothing more than an entire team of players who think and act like offensive linemen, and that team would just so happen to have a premium offensive line paving the way. If this sounds like blasphemy in the place where Chip Kelly revolutionized offensive football in the not-too-distant past, it shouldn’t.”
• Lastly, a dash of perspective: USA Today reporter George Schroeder spent a day inside the SEC’s replay center. This detailed account was published last season but nonetheless serves as a point of comparison for Pac-12 fans wondering how the replay operation works elsewhere. (Psst: Better than it does in the Pac-12.)

						U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Karl Mondon/file)		
	
By John Woolfolk | jwoolfolk@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: June 5, 2018 at 8:42 pm | UPDATED: June 6, 2018 at 3:51 am


U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein was headed for a November runoff with a commanding lead over the former state Senate leader, Kevin de León, her best-known and best-funded Democratic rival, who in early returns Wednesday morning was neck and neck with little-known Republican James P. Bradley.

With her years of experience, Feinstein was the clear favorite among voters Tuesday, even if some weren’t totally excited about her bid for a fifth full, six-year term.

“She’s been there forever, but I didn’t really see anybody who could take her place who was qualified,” said Elizabeth Alvarez, 60, a registered Democrat from San Jose.

Under California’s “top-two” primary enacted after Feinstein’s last re-election in 2012, the two candidates with the most votes compete in November regardless of party. With no notable Republican among Feinstein’s 31 challengers in deep blue California, political experts said it was likely two Democrats would be on the ballot in November. The same thing happened in 2016, when only two Democrats — Sen. Kamala Harris and then-Rep. Loretta Sanchez — were on the Senate ballot in the fall.

But Bradley, a Laguna Niguel businessman and U.S. Coast Guard veteran, has done surprisingly well in some polls despite not raising campaign cash. Still, most surveys have suggested de León would ultimately emerge as the runner-up. Results from many large counties were still trickling in late Tuesday.

Two polls last month put Feinstein 24 percentage points ahead of de León with more than a third of voters undecided.

As of 3 a.m. Wednesday, Feinstein was well ahead with 44 percent of the vote, with de León at 11.3 percent and Bradley at 8.7 percent.

“What we thought we’d be looking at is how close will Kevin de León get,” Thad Kousser, a political science professor UC San Diego who has followed the Senate primary, said Tuesday. “But I think now what we’re looking for is will he even get to November?”

While much of the vote from de León’s Los Angeles base had yet to be tallied, Kousser said he’d have to narrow the gap with Feinstein significantly to remain a credible threat in November.

					
				

“If he’s within maybe 20 points of Dianne Feinstein, that’s legitimate striking distance,” Kousser said. “He’ll have a bigger and broader electorate in November, more Latino voters, more younger and liberal voters. That would give him a shot. But if he’s much further behind, it doubles down on his challenge to raise money to get his message out there.”

De León however was undaunted. He has barnstormed California in recent days and was upbeat about his chances.

“I’m feeling good,” de León said Tuesday as he headed to Orange County to rally supporters. “Our goal is to get into the top two and if we’re successful, it’ll be a whole new ball game.”

Feinstein was in Washington, D.C., where the Senate was in session Tuesday. She was expected to attend an intelligence committee briefing and to watch from her home in the capital as results come in from the West Coast, said Jeff Millman, a spokesman for her campaign.

“Thanks so much for your support,” Feinstein said in an election-night video released on YouTube. “Now, it’s on to November!”



Feinstein has easily outraised her opponents in campaign cash with nearly $10 million compared to $1.1 million for de León, the only other contender to raise more than $1 million. Democrats Pat Harris raised $703,000 and Alison Hartson $362,000. Among Republicans, engineer Arun Bhumitra led with $54,000.

Feinstein has been among California’s most enduring Democrats, rising to prominence as San Francisco’s first female mayor. She has served in the Senate since 1992.

As a senator Feinstein has championed health care, environmental protection, women’s rights and gun restrictions — she authored the federal government’s 10-year assault weapons ban in 1994, and has introduced a new version.

But Feinstein, who will turn 85 this month and is the Senate’s eldest current member, has faced sharp criticism from younger Democrats who argue for a more full-throated “resistance” to President Donald Trump than Feinstein’s centrism. The state’s Democratic party declined to endorse anyone in the primary, giving Democrat challengers a green light.

State Senator Kevin de Leon (Josie Lepe/Bay Area News Group) 
De León, of Los Angeles, is the author of California’s “sanctuary state” law protecting illegal immigrants without serious criminal records. He argues he has pushed Feinstein to the left on immigration, where both oppose Trump’s policies, and capital punishment, which she recently said she now opposes.

But other Democrats took shots at de León as too friendly with corporate donors and slow to police sexual harassment in the Legislature.

The split among Democrats signaled less-than-enthusiastic support for Feinstein from some voters. Despite being the one candidate with bona fide name recognition, Feinstein didn’t automatically stand out on the ballot among a list of 32 candidates.

Andre Hunt, 66, a registered Democrat from San Jose, said he voted for Feinstein “reluctantly.”

“The Democrats need new, younger leadership,” Hunt said. “I’m not that blown away by Kevin de León either, but they do need new leadership.”

But Jana Hinkle, 66, a San Jose Republican, was comfortable casting her vote for Feinstein, whose leadership on gun control appealed to her.

“She’s had a good track record, especially on the shootings we’ve had in schools,” Hinkle said. “She really wants to take gun control in her hand.”

			The letter says the list includes the names of all priests credibly accused in the past 70 years. It includes 28 priests of the archdiocese and three priests not based in the archdiocese but who worked in its schools or parishes. The three were members of religious orders, or independent communities.

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

By Rick Hurd | rhurd@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: October 11, 2018 at 10:56 am | UPDATED: October 12, 2018 at 10:22 am


ALAMO — The elderly man whose sedan ran off a road and into a ditch on Thursday has been identified by the Contra Costa County Coroner’s Office.

Stanley Mehlhoff, 82, of Alamo crashed in the 2000 block of Danville Boulevard near Rudgear Road, just west of Interstate 680 about 10:30 a.m. He died at the scene.

The Coroner’s Office will perform an autopsy Friday afternoon to determine if Mehlhoff crashed because he suffered a medical event.

Responding officers and paramedics found a silver Volkswagen Beetle sedan in a ditch just west of Danville Boulevard, and Mehlhoff was unresponsive, CHP Officer Brandon Correia said in a statement.

No other people or vehicles were involved.

Investigators believe the Volkswagen was traveling west on Rudgear toward the T-intersection with Danville Boulevard when it drove through the intersection and off the roadway.

Anyone with information is asked to call CHP Contra Costa in Martinez at 925-646-4980.



The line between Alamo and Walnut Creek runs through the intersection at Danville and Rudgear.

By George Kelly | gkelly@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: October 14, 2018 at 10:22 pm | UPDATED: October 15, 2018 at 6:57 am


REDWOOD CITY — A 20-year-old South San Francisco woman was killed in a weekend solo crash on Interstate 280, the California Highway Patrol said.

Just after 1:50 a.m. Sunday, officers with the CHP’s Redwood City office responded to reports of a solo collision on northbound I-280, north of Edgewood Road.

When officers and an ambulance arrived, they found the woman lying in the No. 3 lane. Despite paramedics’ efforts, she was pronounced dead at the scene.



In a statement, investigators said they believe the woman was driving at unknown speeds when her 2009 Toyota veered right, leaving the road’s eastern edge and going up a hillside. When the Toyota came back onto the roadway, it overturned and ejected the woman, who was not wearing a seatbelt. Officers said either drugs or alcohol appear to have been collision factors.

Officers kept the No. 1 lane of northbound I-280 open while investigators worked the scene, closing the other three lanes for about three hours.

Anyone with information on the accident should call CHP Officer Spencer Curteman at the Redwood City CHP office at 650-369-6261.

Contact George Kelly at 408-859-5180.

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

First and 10



Five big questions heading into Week 9

Welcome back to Bay Area Preps HQ, which we hope is becoming appointment viewing as midseason quickly is becoming late in the season for Bay Area high school football teams.

In this edition, we’ve got Las Lomas’ rise from 0-10 to 8-0, our weekend video preview, Serra-Valley Christian, an upset alert, athletes of the week, basketball players giving back and plenty more.

On to the questions …

1. Can Valley Christian keep pace with Serra?

In its two losses this season, tight games against Wilcox and St. Francis, Valley Christian scored nine points total. That’s not going to cut it Friday night at home against Serra, the reigning West Catholic Athletic League champion. Led by senior quarterback Luke Bottari, the Padres have scored 142 points in their first three league games, with all but 21 of them coming before halftime in blowout wins over Mitty, Bellarmine and Riordan. Serra might not score 40 against Valley, but the Padres don’t figure to be held to single digits or in the low teens. Serra has won seven of the past eight meetings in this series and scored no fewer than 24 points in any of them. In other words, Valley, which lost to Serra twice last season, will need to put the ball in the end zone more than once or twice Friday to remain in the league title race.

2. SoCal buzz: How big is St. John Bosco-Mater Dei?

You can be certain that De La Salle will have a close eye on what unfolds in Santa Ana on Friday night when national No. 1 St. John Bosco-Bellflower takes on national No. 2 and defending national champ Mater Dei-Santa Ana. Last year, Mater Dei won the regular-season game between the Southern California superpowers and then beat Bosco again in the Southern Section Division I final before rolling through DLS for the state Open crown. Two years ago, Bosco lost the regular-season game against Mater Dei but won the rematch before cruising past DLS in the Open state title game. The matchup Friday is once again filled with college prospects as MaxPreps notes that 47 players have at least three-star recruiting ratings. Yes, this is still 11-man football. But just like the previous two years, the Trinity League game Friday is probably an appetizer, with the main course served later in the season.

3. Will Sacred Heart Cathedral make history against Bellarmine?

					
				

In the MaxPreps era of datakeeping (2004-forward), Bellarmine has played Sacred Heart Cathedral on 10 occasions. Bellarmine has not lost any of them, winning all but one by double digits. This is noteworthy because when the WCAL teams play Friday night at San Jose City College, the Irish have a chance, a very good chance to erase that zero from the record. Calpreps.com’s computer projects that SHC will win a tight game, 21-17, an outcome that likely would cause more dancing in the hallways at the San Francisco school. Last week, the Irish rallied to edge archrival St. Ignatius 26-21 in the Bruce-Mahoney game. An SHC win Friday would improve its record to 4-3 overall and 2-2 in the WCAL. Bellarmine, a proud program that has fallen on lean times, would slide to 2-5, 1-3 and be very much in danger of a second consecutive losing season. St. Francis and Valley Christian are the next two opponents on the Bells’ schedule.



4. What’s to gain for De La Salle against Foothill?

De La Salle beat a good Monte Vista team 55-0 last week. The Spartans now play host to a Foothill team Friday night that has struggled to win this season. What’s to gain for DLS? Not much in terms of resume building. But the Spartans, who figure to have three byes in a six-week stretch during the playoffs, need to stay as sharp as possible while avoiding injuries that could affect them in bigger games down the road. Look for the DLS reserves to get a lot of action, just as they did last week. Starting running back Shamar Garrett carried four times against Monte Vista, finishing with 171 yards and two TDs.

5. Who’s on upset alert?

To be blunt, there are not many games this week that scream upset. Four teams in the Bay Area News Group Top 10 are projected to win by at least 60 — yes, 60 — and two others are predicted to squeak out victories by at least four touchdowns, according to calpreps.com’s computer. So we don’t see any upsets there. But one team that should be careful is 23rd-ranked Sacred Heart Prep, which ran its record to 6-0 last week with a 36-14 win over Aragon. Before their huge game next week at home against Peninsula Athletic League Bay Division favorite Menlo-Atherton, the Gators travel Friday night to Half Moon Bay (3-3), which has dropped off considerably after last season’s magical run to a state championship game but is still dangerous, especially on its home field during pumpkin season. Don’t be shocked if the Cougars, who had an awful second half in a loss to Menlo last week, bounce back and find a way to win.

What to watch

For more on the weekend’s top matchups and the weekend schedule, check out our “Bay Area Games to Watch” preview here.



New vibe



How Las Lomas went from 0-10 to 8-0

Nestled on the edge of downtown Walnut Creek, a stone’s throw from Whole Foods and Broadway Plaza mall, sits Las Lomas High — a clean and cozy public school with a nice history in athletics.

A quick search through the record book shows that the football program has won four North Coast Section championships, most recently in 2005.

The school also has celebrated section titles in several other sports and just this past winter its boys basketball team won a Northern California championship, making it all the way to state.

But rewind the clock two years and the football team was anything but a stone’s throw from a championship.

The Knights went 0-10 in 2016, losing all five of their league games by three touchdowns or more, a miserable season that has made this one all the more special.

“This season is amazing, especially from where we came from two years ago,” said senior quarterback Dylan Graham, who started on the 2016 team. “No one would have thought about it two years ago. Now it’s actually reality.”

It, of course, being what has unfolded through the final weeks of summer and early weeks of fall, the eight wins without a loss, the 46 points allowed and 392 scored, the complete domination game after game.

“I’ve been through the worst and so far this is the best,” Graham added.

The change in direction began when Doug Longero returned as coach last season after four years at Diablo Valley College. Longero led Las Lomas to three of its NCS football championships, and his reemergence shifted the vibe.

“Longero, oh my God, has brought so much to this program,” running back/linebacker Isaiah Newell said. “He’s kind of been like our shining star.”

Video: What do Sabedra and Lefkow have to say?

In our weekly video preview, Mike Lefkow and I discuss the weekend’s top matchups, including Serra-Valley Christian, Granada-Monte Vista and more. Plus we touch on league alignments in the NCS. Teaser: Lefkow is ready to push De La Salle and Clayton Valley Charter to new leagues. “Let’s cut to the chase,” he said. “This cries out for what they need to do. Make these leagues competitively balanced. You’ve got to start changing teams around.”

Check it out here.

Familiar faces



Palo Alto coach takes on former team

Nelson Gifford — middle in photo above, courtesy of Karen Ambrose Hickey — spent the past five years on the staff at Fremont High in Sunnyvale.

Now the head coach at his alma mater, Pato Alto, Gifford’s new team takes on his old one Friday night.

He discussed the reunion and more in this Q&A with our Vytas Mazeika.





In the spotlight

Piedmont Hills’ Gabriel Reclusado (football), Woodside’s Sarah Perry (cross country), Pittsburg’s Premier Murphy (football) and Carondelet’s Kiki Mein (water polo) are the Bay Area News Group’s athletes of the week.

As always, many others were noted in our weekly Highlight Reel and Movin’ on Up.



Two-minute drill

— Saratoga’s Payton Stokes had a game for the ages last week, throwing for 472 yards and seven TDs and rushing for 103 yards and a TD. What will he do for an encore Friday at Gunn?

— The King’s Academy takes aim on winning a league championship with a big game Friday against Sequoia.

— Leland appears to be heating up at the right time after a rough start. Back-to-back wins have put the Chargers (3-3, 2-1) in the thick of the BVAL Mt. Hamilton Division race heading into a game Friday against Live Oak (5-1, 2-1).



Hoops story



Friends from South Bay, Peninsula schools teaching basketball

Harker brothers Gene and Ray Wang, Leland’s Joseph Chen, Cupertino’s John Duan, Lynbrook’s Ian Tai and St. Francis’ Roy Yuan don’t just play basketball.

As Mazeika reports in this story, they’re teach it.

For free.

“All the other camps that we were helping with, kids had to pay to come — and, I guess, that we decided that we could do it for free,” said Gene Wang, the president of the nonprofit Bay Area Basketball Academy. “And we could bring our own separate experiences to the table and really teach these kids not only how to play basketball, but also all the other stuff that we’ve learned as student-athletes.”

By Zunera Ashar | Mosaic
PUBLISHED: July 18, 2018 at 11:03 am | UPDATED: July 18, 2018 at 11:07 am


Los Gatos United Methodist Church wants visitors to see humanity in everyone. At its “Open the Door! Art from Within” exhibit, prisoners currently incarcerated in Santa Clara Correctional Facilities are showing off their artwork until the end of the month.

The program originally began as a workshop for the inmates to connect with a spiritual journey.

“One of the women asked me ‘Who will see this artwork?’ but what she meant was ‘Who will see us?’” said Elaine Bondonno, the program director. “because they feel invisible to society when they’re behind the bars.”

This led to the organization creating exhibitions for people to see the inmates’ artwork.

The interior of the papier-mâché piece “Masks” represents the internalized attributes of the artists while the exterior represents the gifts that they would like to share to the world. It’s one of the art pieces on display at the Los Gatos United Methodist Church’s Open the Door! Art from Within exhibit of inmate art. (Zunera Asher photo) 
For seven years, six exhibitions of their art work have been exposed to communities in Santa Clara County Hall of Justice, the Santa Clara Government Center, Valley Medical Center, Ameriprise Financial, the San Jose Quilt and Textile Museum, and San Jose’s Tabard Theater.

The exhibition at the Los Gatos church includes newer pieces not previously shown.

The theme of all the artwork is transformation and healing. A piece titled “Metamorphosis” is a collage of origami butterflies made from penal code paper. The black butterflies represent the isolation the inmates feel when they’re locked up and the colorful butterflies represent the free and newly healed inmates.

“Through the artwork they showed what it’s like to address the issue of being labeled,” said Bondonno.

Though art is often created in solitude, the pieces in the exhibition were a collaborative effort.

					
				

“Inmates are able to share life’s challenges, find they are valued by others, and become part of a greater whole,” said a statement from the church.

One piece located inside the church’s sanctuary, titled “Colors of Hope”, is a large textile woven piece with a large heart in the center that reads as “Trusts God Always”. The women hand-dyed each strip, determined the heart design, and then wove it all together.

When the artists were asked to reflect about this piece, one of the women said that the piece represents an intertwining of personalities, beliefs, trusts and bending without breaking.

Visitors get a chance to leave feedback on post-it notes for the inmates. One of the notes read as “I never understood why Jesus told us to visit those in prison until my son was incarcerated. We must give hope and work for healing. Life is too precious to give away!”

The exhibition is still open to the public on Wednesdays from 6-9 p.m., it closes July 29. The church is located at 111 Church St, Los Gatos. Visit lgumc.org for more details.

PUBLISHED: September 3, 2018 at 12:25 pm | UPDATED: September 3, 2018 at 4:40 pm


SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO — A suspect was arrested shortly after a person was found stabbed multiple times in a residential neighborhood early Saturday, according to police.

Officers were called about 2:20 a.m. for a report of a stabbing and found a victim suffering from “multiple stab wounds,” according to South San Francisco police.

The officers applied first aid until paramedics arrived, and the victim was taken to the hospital with what were described as non-life threatening injuries.

The suspect, who fled after the attack, was found and arrested soon after, police said. He has since been identified as 34-year-old Brendan Ira Harris of South San Francisco.

Harris was booked at the San Mateo County jail on suspicion of attempted murder and is being held without bail, according to jail records.

Anyone with information about the stabbing can contact police at 650-877-8900 or leave an anonymous tip at 650-952-2244 or by emailing tip@ssf.net.

FIRST IN AN OCCASIONAL SERIES

Editor’s note:  Is the California Dream still valid? Compared to the rest of the nation, we are expensive – and making ends meet gets tougher for many of us each year. We have the nation’s highest rates for poverty and income inequality and we face a deepening housing-affordability crisis. Our state has an unfunded debt approaching $400 billion for public-employee retirement and billions more for outstanding bonds. Add to that a massive infrastructure backlog. And yet, many argue, Californians are more diverse, safer and better educated than ever.

As a pivotal election nears, the issues gripping the state will shape life decisions about where to live, about raising our families and about choosing our careers.

This story is the first installment of the California Dream project, created by a statewide nonprofit media collaboration focused on issues of economic opportunity, quality-of-life, and the future of the California Dream. Partner organizations include CALMatters, Capital Public Radio, KPBS, KPCC, and KQED with support provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the James Irvine Foundation. You can share your California dream on Twitter by using the hashtag #CADream.



By Matt Levin, CALMatters


California is an expensive state. The cost for housing, gas, electricity and other basics is often more than elsewhere in America. We have the nation’s highest rates for poverty and income inequality. Meanwhile, government resources are stretched thin. But the news isn’t all bad in the Golden State. We’re safer than we used to be. And we’re better educated. And much more diverse. Here’s a statistical glimpse of key trends in our state. 



HOUSING

In 1960, average California renters saw about 20 percent of their income go to rent. That’s up to nearly 37 percent now. The trend is even steeper for younger Californians, who are seeing nearly half their paychecks go to rent.

When rents are higher, it gets tougher for renters to save money for a down payment on a house. That, combined with rising single-family home prices and the end of easy mortgages, has sent California’s rate of homeownership dipping.

					
				



WHOSE DREAM IS THIS?

	Demographics


As recently as 1970, whites accounted for more than 70 percent of the population. That has changed dramatically. Driven by the tremendous growth of its Latino and Asian populations, California is now famously a “majority minority” state, where no ethnic group claims more than 50 percent of residents. The number of white Californians has actually dropped by about 2 million since 1990.

	Inequality


An increasingly diverse California, however, has not translated into an increasingly equal one. While the average Asian household has caught up to whites, both Latino and African American families make significantly less — with that gap only widening in the wake of the Great Recession of the late 2000s.

“The bulk of California’s workforce is going to be young Latinos now,” said Sonja Diaz, founding director of the UCLA Latino Policy & Politics Institute. “But Latinos still lag behind in a number of socioeconomic indicators, in terms of homeownership, income gains, educational attainment, access to health care, living wage jobs.”



	Immigration


California has always been a magnet for immigrants from around the world. While the rate has slowed in recent years, the state still has the largest concentration of foreign-born residents in the country.

But starting in the 1990s, California appears to have lost much

of its lure to the rest of the U.S. Over the past two decades, California has lost 1.8 million more residents than it has gained from the rest of the country. And unlike in previous decades, that trend is persisting through good economic times.

HIGHER EDUCATION

Clark Kerr, University of California president from 1958 to 1961, was the architect of the state’s 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education. Kerr envisioned a world-class public university system accessible to the top third of state high school students.

Partly due to Kerr’s ambitions, Californians are a lot more educated than they used to be. The percentage of Californians with a bachelor’s degree has nearly tripled since 1960, with particularly strong gains among women. Graduation rates at the University of California are some of the highest in recent decades.

But adjusted for inflation, the cost of one year of a University of California education is seven times what it was in the mid-1960s. That’s mostly because state support for the UC started dwindling in the early 2000s. At its peak, the state provided more than $26,000 per student. It now provides about half that.



TAXES

California has a reputation as a high-tax state. Has that always been the case?

Depends on how much money you make and what type of tax you’re talking about.

While the state has increasingly leaned on high earners to foot the cost of government over the past few decades, the median California household has actually seen its income tax bill drop.

Effective property taxes in California have dipped below the average in most other states since the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, which limits what local governments can collect as property values rise.

California now has one of the lowest effective property tax rates in the country.

But one regressive tax has increased significantly since the 1960s: the sales tax. In 1964, the state sales tax totaled 4 percent. That rose past 7 percent by the early 2000s.

THE ECONOMY

The decline of manufacturing and the sharp exodus of blue-collar jobs with decent pay and good benefits are an economic narrative typically reserved for the Rust Belt. But in explaining the erosion of California’s middle class, the decline of manufacturing — particularly in the defense and aerospace industries that dominated Southern California during the Cold War — plays a central role.

“Silicon Valley does not provide those kind of big manufacturing jobs,” said Dan Mitchell, professor emeritus at the Anderson School of Management at UCLA. “There’s no equivalent of in aircraft assembly plant that you get from that.

IT does provide high-paying, white-collar jobs, but certainly not as many and not in the same location.”

On the positive side, in good times California’s economy continues to outshine most of the U.S. In 13 of the past 20 years, the state’s annual economic growth has surpassed the national rate.

But California has always been a boom-and-bust state, and recessions play out worse here than elsewhere. The recession of the early 1990s, the dot-com bust at the turn of the century and the Great Recession all hit California harder than most of the rest of the country.

One indisputable improvement in California’s quality of life over the past few decades: The state is a lot safer than it used to be.
Rates of violent and property crime have reached lows not seen since the late 1960s. California’s crime drop is part of a broader national trend. And along with most other states, California has seen a major increase in its incarceration rate over the same period.



 

The California Dream series is a statewide media collaboration of CALmatters, KPBS, KPCC, KQED and KXPR with support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the James Irvine Foundation.

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

Bust out the fluffy stack of pancakes, it’s national pancake day.

Sept. 26 actually started out in 2005 as Lumberjack Day, in which lumberjacks nationwide celebrated by eating pancakes. From there, it evolved into a day to honor one of our favorite breakfast staples. To mark the day, here are a few recipes we’ve sampled — and loved.

Blue monkey pancakes with bacon are served at the Casini Ranch Family Campground in Duncans Mills, Calif., on Friday, April 18, 2014. (Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group) 
For a delicious take on classic buttermilk pancakes, try Val’s Pancakes.

Switch things up with whole wheat pastry flour and you’ll get the delectable Multigrain Pancakes from Heidi Swanson, author of “Super Natural Every Day.”

These Blue Monkey Pancakes bring fruit flavors forward with a blend of bananas and blueberries.

From the pages of “The Joy of Cooking,” these Cornmeal Pancakes feature a touch of honey.

If traditional breakfast flapjacks aren’t your thing, you can opt for a savory appetizer with Zucchini Pancakes with Feta, Capers and Mint.

Or you can dig into Rich Table’s Sweet Potato Pancakes with Dried Apricot Salsa Verde, from the “Rich Table” cookbook, written by the creative minds behind Michelin-starred Rich Table in San Francisco.

By Simon Denyer | The Washington Post 

TOKYO — At least 85 people have died and 58 are unaccounted for as torrential rains continued to batter parts of western Japan on Sunday, causing landslides and flooding and forcing millions of people from their homes, local media reported. 

The conditions halted operations at companies ranging from Panasonic to Amazon.com. 

Television footage showed bridges and cars washed away by raging rivers and floodwaters, with people perched on the roofs of their homes, surrounded by water and awaiting rescue. 

Japan’s Meteorological Agency had issued rare “emergency warnings” against landslides, rising rivers, strong winds and lightning strikes caused by what it called “historic” rains in 23 prefectures across the western and central parts of the country. The rains began Thursday and continued into Sunday in many areas. 

Such warnings are issued in anticipation of the sort of extreme conditions that occur just once or twice in 50 years, Kyodo News reported. 

					
				

“There are still many people missing and others in need of help. We are working against time,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday morning. 

More than 1.6 million people were ordered to evacuate their homes, while 3.1 million were put on high alert and urged to do so. Nevertheless, Kyodo said, many had remained at home. 

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said 54,000 police officers, firefighters, and members of Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and coast guard had been mobilized in the rescue effort, Kyodo reported, with TV footage showing them using boats and helicopters to bring people to safety. 

Public broadcaster NHK said flooding and landslides were hindering rescue efforts and repeatedly urged people not to lose hope. 

Among the dead was a 3-year-old girl whose home was hit by a landslide in Hiroshima prefecture, Reuters reported. 

“It’s very painful,” said one elderly man watching nearby. “I have a granddaughter the same age. If it were her, I wouldn’t be able to stop crying.” 

Two sisters from an elementary school with just six students on the small island of Nuwa in Ehime prefecture also died, according to Reuters. The younger, a first-grader, was a star and the hope of the depopulated island, the principal told NHK. 

The western Hiroshima prefecture was hit the hardest by landslides, which claimed 37 lives, while 21 people died in Ehime, NHK reported. 

In August 2014, 77 people died in Hiroshima when torrential rain triggered massive landslides, but one resident told Kyodo that the rains were heavier this time. 

Auto manufacturers Mitsubishi and Mazda were forced to halt production at some factories because they could not get parts or did not want to force employees to travel to work in dangerous conditions, Kyodo reported. 

Below is a summary of reports on company outages: 

	Power outages knocked out connectivity for NTT Docomo Inc. users in areas from Kyoto to Hiroshima, the carrier said in a statement.
	Amazon stopped work at a distribution center in Okayama prefecture on Saturday. Operations re-started early Sunday after truck passages were cleared, according to a company spokesman.
	Panasonic halted production of video cameras at a plant in Okayama city, the Nikkei reported.
	Mitsubishi Motors halted operations at its Okayama plant as it was unable to procure parts, while Daihatsu Motor, a mini-vehicle making unit of Toyota Motor, said it had suspended production at two plants in Osaka and Kyoto for the same reason, Kyoto reported.
	Mazda Motor halted weekend production at a factory in Hiroshima, a company representative said on Sunday.
	Kyushu Electric Power’s Sendai No. 1 nuclear reactor was operating normally, according to the company’s website. Calls to the company were not answered outside normal hours.
	Sony reported no damage across the company, including at plants that produce smartphone camera chips for Apple, according to a company spokesman.
	A total of 208 convenience stores or supermarkets were not operating throughout western Japan, the country’s trade ministry said early Sunday.


Separately, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Chiba prefecture on Saturday evening, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The quake shook buildings in Tokyo, but the government said there was no immediate danger of a tsunami and local media reported limited damage.

						Assemblywoman Catharine Baker		
	
By Mercury News & East Bay Times Editorial Boards | 
PUBLISHED: May 12, 2018 at 8:15 am | UPDATED: October 15, 2018 at 12:47 pm


Because Assemblywoman Catharine Baker has an R after her name she has a political target on her back.

With Democrats trying to regain their two-thirds supermajority in the state Assembly, they desperately want to recapture the East Bay’s 16th District seat, which stretches from Orinda to Livermore.

Their campaign strategy: Portray Baker as a gun lover who opposes abortion rights, pay equity, environmental protections, education funding and public transportation. The problem is that’s wrong on all counts.

Assemblywoman Catharine Baker (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)
A refreshing voice of independent thought in an overly partisan Legislature, Baker deserves re-election. And she doesn’t deserve the continuous distortion of her record by her opponent, Orinda attorney Rebecca Bauer-Kahan.

Since her election in 2014, Baker has steered a thoughtful, bipartisan, centrist course that reflects her district, in which neither party holds a majority and independent voters are the key to victory.

She has supported most gun-control laws and consistently backed a woman’s right to choose, earning a 100 percent voting record in 2016 and 2017 from Planned Parenthood, although she disagreed with the group more often than not in 2015.

On the environment, she was lauded by Gov. Jerry Brown as the “one brave Republican” in the Assembly when she voted for extending greenhouse gas reduction targets.

					
				

And she provided one of only three Republicans votes to place the Proposition 68 park bond on the June ballot. For her “proven … commitment to the environment” and “strong voice … protecting park resources and access,” she was endorsed by the non-profit California Park and Recreation Society.

Baker also received the California School Boards Association Outstanding Legislator Award. And she spearheaded the recent deal to bring a much-needed BART parking garage to Dublin that the transit agency had refused to provide.

On pay equity, Baker voted for key 2015 legislation toughening laws against gender salary discrimination and a 2017 law prohibiting use of salary history to determine what to pay new workers.

Baker is discerning, carefully reads bills before her and is unafraid to cast difficult votes. She opposes letting BART workers strike and awarding teachers tenure after, effectively, just 18 months on the job. She wisely opposes lifting the state’s restrictions on rent control laws, which would hinder construction of new homes. And she backs the governor’s Supreme Court fight to correct the state’s ridiculous public employee pension vesting rules.

In contrast, Bauer-Kahan says that BART should somehow negotiate a no-strike provision. She hasn’t thought about how long teachers should work before receiving tenure. She wants to lift the state’s restrictions on rent controls. And she opposes changing the state’s pension vesting rules in most cases.

Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)
Moreover, Bauer-Kahan, who has not held elective office, sprays sweeping and false statements about the incumbent. When questioned about her inaccuracies, she frequently responds with, “that’s what I was told.” That’s not an acceptable excuse for lowering the level of political discourse. Voters deserve better.

To understand the misrepresentation, consider the issue of gun control. Bauer-Kahan claims that Baker “doesn’t support reasonable gun regulations.” Actually, Baker has voted for 28 gun-control bills, perhaps the only Republican in Sacramento to so consistently buck the gun lobby.

She voted to expand background checks. Expand the prohibition on open carrying of weapons. And raise the minimum age for purchasing rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21, just like handguns.

With the federal government unwilling to fund research on gun violence, Baker co-authored legislation for a state center to do the work. And she opposed congressional Republicans’ push to let gun owners with concealed weapons permits traipse into California with their hidden firearms.

Despite all that, Bauer-Kahan cherry-picks Baker votes to suggest she’s a gun-lover. “My opponent has voted against … a bill that would prohibit the possession of firearms with large-capacity magazines,” Bauer-Kahan wrote.

Actually, for nearly two decades, the state has banned almost all assault weapons and the future sale and manufacture of large-capacity magazines. In 2016, Baker was one of only two Assembly Republicans who voted for legislation that closed loopholes in that assault weapons ban.

Baker did vote against a bill barring possession of magazines manufactured before the 1999 ban on future sales. To Baker, an attorney, the bill was an unconstitutional seizing of property without compensation. With compensation, she said, she would have supported it.

That’s a position many might disagree with. But it’s a reasoned one that does not justify branding her an opponent of gun laws, as Bauer-Kahan has tried to do.

Bauer-Kahan also tries to portray Baker as a fan of weaponry in the classroom. “Despite the fact she (Baker) has children in high school, she’s OK with guns on our school campuses,” Bauer-Kahan told a group of supporters.

But, again, that’s not what the record shows. Since 1996, California has prohibited guns near and on campuses. But there was an exception for people who had permits to carry concealed weapons.

In 2016, Baker was one of two Republicans who supported successful legislation requiring those with concealed-carry permits also obtain permission from the school district superintendent, a requirement strongly supported by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

The following year, lawmakers went further, eliminating the ability of school superintendents to grant permission in special circumstances. Baker abstained because she wanted superintendents to retain the discretion — sought the year before by the Brady Campaign — in cases of people who had been the victims of stalking or domestic violence.

Gun-control advocates could reasonably disagree with Baker’s position. But Bauer-Kahan uses it to draw a sweeping conclusion that Baker is “OK with guns on our school campuses.” That’s a gross distortion.

Similarly, on abortion, Bauer-Kahan claims that Baker is “anti-choice.” Bauer-Kahan doesn’t mention Baker’s perfect Planned Parenthood voting record the past two years.

Instead, she reaches back to 2015 and locks onto Baker’s vote against a now-famous bill requiring facilities that steer pregnant women away from abortion to post notices about the availability of state-subsidized abortions.

To Bauer-Kahan, that vote makes the case that Baker opposes a woman’s right to choose. She ignores that Baker opposed the bill because of First Amendment concerns that it mandates speech.

Baker’s concern is the very issue that concerned even liberal Justice Elena Kagan when the U.S. Supreme Court held oral arguments before deciding by next month whether the law is constitutional.

There are legitimate reasons for Bauer-Kahan to disagree with some of Baker’s votes. But that’s not an excuse for wholesale distortion.

Because they are the only two candidates in the primary, they will meet again in the November general election. Let’s hope the level of discourse improves by then.

In the meantime, Baker is the superior, and more honest, candidate. She deserves re-election.

CONCORD – There are fast starts, and then there was the start that De La Salle’s offense had against Monte Vista on Friday.

The Spartans scored touchdowns on their first two plays from scrimmage, and three of their first six plays, on their way to a 55-0 domination.

Two of those first three touchdowns came from Shamar Garrett. The junior took De La Salle’s first play 88 yards into the end zone, and scored his second rushing touchdown on a 65-yard run. He finished with four rushes for 168 yards, all in the first quarter.

“I love the way that Shamar ran, and then we were able to throw effectively too, so that was nice,” said De La Salle coach Justin Alumbaugh. “That’s a good team. I don’t think they’ve given up more than 17 the entire year. I was just really pleased with our execution. There weren’t a lot of mistakes early on.”

Spartans quarterback Dorian Hale threw three touchdown passes in the first half, including two to Isaiah Foskey (40 and 17 yards). His last pass of the night was an 82-yard score to Grant Daley. Hale completed three of his five passes for 146 yards, with all of his attempts occurring in the first 20 minutes of the game.

De La Salle improved to 7-0 overall and 1-0 in the East Bay Athletic League Mountain Division. It was the Spartans’ first official league game in seven years. Monte Vista fell to 5-2 overall and 1-1 in Mountain Division play.

Monte Vista took the first possession of the game and drove into the red zone, as quarterback Jack Stewardson completed two of his first three passes 51 yards. But an errant snap on a second-and-10 play on the De La Salle 12 lost 23 yards for the Mustangs, who didn’t get back into the red zone the rest of the game.

Garrett and the Spartans offense didn’t waste any time scoring, as he blasted through the Mustangs defense for his 88-yard touchdown run.

					
				

“I just had good blocks from the line,” Garrett said. “There was a wide-open hole. They hit their blocks and I had to execute my plan.”



De La Salle did not score a touchdown in the second half of its last game, a 31-24 victory at Buchanan-Clovis on Sept. 21, and it was evident that the Spartans’ offense was intent on reaching the end zone early this game.

“It was like a redemption game,” said Garrett about the Monte Vista game. “We knew we had to come out strong for this game.”

After Garrett’s 88-yard run, Monte Vista went three-and-out. Hale threw the 40-yard touchdown pass to Foskey on the next play. Garrett scored on his 65-yard run in the next series, then Hale connected with Foskey on their second touchdown pass, as De La Salle led 28-0 at the end of the first quarter.

An 80-yard run by James Coby provided De La Salle’s next touchdown, then Hale threw his final pass of the game to Daley for a touchdown. Andrew Jones, who had been alternating series with Hale up to that point in the game, fired a 26-yard touchdown pass to LuMagia Hearns III as De La Salle held a 48-0 halftime lead.

“I like the execution. We didn’t fumble the ball, we had no turnovers,” Alumbaugh said. “A lot of times we come back from a bye week and we’re a little sloppy, a little rusty, but I thought these guys responded well.”

There was a running clock throughout the second half. De La Salle scored its final touchdown on a four-yard run by Jack Fulp in the third quarter.

Oh, the stories: Living in New York City and afraid of elevators. A look at plastic-bag bans in the United States and around the world. A National Geographic long read on the lives of nomads in the Amazon jungle. And photographic “proof” of the existence of fairies and gnomes is for sale.

By JAMES ELLINGWORTH | The Associated Press

MOSCOW — One of two men detained in Kazakhstan on suspicion of killing Olympic figure skating medalist Denis Ten has confessed, authorities said Friday.

Prosecutor Berik Zhuyrektayev said in a televised statement that Nuraly Kiyasov “confessed his guilt in the presence of an attorney” while being questioned over the 25-year-old skater’s death Thursday in the Kazakh city of Almaty.

The prosecutor didn’t give further details of what exactly Kiyasov had said.

Police have also detained 23-year-old Arman Kudaibergenov in connection with Ten’s death, which has prompted national mourning. Authorities released a picture of the disheveled-looking man being held by masked men wearing body armor and camouflage uniforms.

Ten was stabbed after a dispute with people who allegedly tried to steal a mirror from his car in his home city of Almaty. He died in hospital of massive blood loss from multiple wounds, the Kazinform news agency said.

Prosecutors are treating his death as murder.

Kazinform reported that Kiyasov was taken to the scene of the crime under heavy security Friday as part of the investigation.

					
				

Ten’s bronze in Sochi in 2014 made him Kazakhstan’s first Olympic medalist in figure skating. He also won the Four Continents championships in 2015, and was a world championship silver medalist in 2013.

He struggled with injuries in recent years and could only finish 27th at the Pyeongchang Olympics in February.

Ten had been working on a script in recent months which the Kazakh-Russian director Timur Bekmambetov said Friday would now be turned into a movie.
“We’re definitely going to try to realize his idea and shoot a film dedicated to this multi-talented person,” Bekmambetov said in comments released by Kazakhstan’s embassy to Russia. “In his 25 years, Ten managed to do very much and had grand plans which he would surely have put into practice because he was a real hard worker.”

	San Jose: Reward for information in man’s slaying extended

		
	Jason Green
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 12, 2018 at 12:11 am | UPDATED: October 12, 2018 at 2:23 pm

	SAN JOSE — A $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in a San Jose man’s slaying last month is being extended another 60 days.
Francisco “Frankie” Santos Jr. III Francisco “Frankie” Santos Jr. III, a 28-year-old husband and father of two sons, was fatally stabbed outside his Burbank neighborhood home during the early morning hours of Sept. 2.
Family members say Santos Jr. was a victim of a “random act of violence.” A flier advertising the reward described him as a “father, a husband, a son, a brother, a grandson, a friend, a 49ers season ticket holder, a gym bro, a project manager, a man of faith.”


“He loved living a healthy and honest life,” the flier continued. “He was not involved in any conflicts. His biggest argument being that the 49ers are better than the Raiders.”
The same flier also contained updated information about the suspect vehicle, which was initially identified as a GMC or Chevrolet full-size pickup truck. It was actually a 2004 Nissan Titan.

Mothers Against Murder, the Los Altos-based non-profit organization offering the $5,000 reward, initially set a deadline in the hopes of bringing a swift resolution to the case.
“Reward offers do work and always bring calls in to law enforcement,” Executive Director Margaret Petros said. “We know the timely reward we put out did generate interest and calls to the (Santa Clara County) Sheriff’s Office.”
In addition to extending the reward another 60 days, the group is seeking to double the amount through donations.
“We wish people out there hear the family’s pain and if anyone knows something to call the sheriff’s office,” Petros said.
“Specifically, we want to send a message to all the gang members who have been harassing people and businesses in the Burbank area to feel this family’s pain and know there is a way out of the criminal gang behavior,” she continued. “There are resources and professionals available to help gang members turn their lives around. Sooner or later, we believe, Frankie’s killers will face justice and it can’t be pleasant.”
This 2004 Nissan Titan has been linked to the stabbing death of Francisco “Frankie” Santos Jr. III outside his Burbank neighborhood home on Sept. 2. (Courtesy of the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office) Anyone with information about the killing can call sheriff’s office investigators at 408-808-4500 or the anonymous tip line at 408-808-4431.

HERCULES — A California Highway Patrol motorcycle officer narrowly avoided a serious crash after the pursuit of another vehicle led to a collision with a Jeep Cherokee, the agency said.

The incident started around 6 p.m. Monday after the officer spotted a white Hyundai Sonata with paper plates going between 90 mph on westbound Interstate 80 near the Willow Avenue exit, spokesman Officer Brandon Correia said. Neither the officer nor the driver of the jeep suffered any injuries.

The Hyundai got away, and the CHP still was looking for the driver.

The officer had been on I-80 enforcing speed regulations, Correia said, when the Hyundai went speeding past him. Initially, the Hyundai began to slow down and appeared to be pulling over, but just before stopping, the driver accelerated back onto westbound I-80, this time reaching approximately 100 mph, Correia said.

The officer followed him and reported that the Hyundai driver also was driving recklessly. Eventually, the Hyundai veered across all the lanes and onto the right shoulder at Appian Way, Correia said.

That maneuver cut off a green Jeep Cherokee, Correia said, and that driver lost control and veered into the center divider. The Jeep crashed directly in front of the CHP motorcycle and the two vehicles collided.

According to Correia, the officer slowed the motorcycle down enough just prior to the crash that he was able to keep the motorcycle upright. Several citizens stopped to assist the officer and the Jeep driver, Correia said.

“The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” is one of the greatest albums of all time, a groundbreaking work of emotional and artistic depth that completely mesmerized the music world when it came out in 1998.

It went on to sell over 8 million copies in the U.S. alone and win multiple Grammys, including the award for album of the year.

Twenty years after its release, “Miseducation” is still a fantastic sounding album — and it still fascinates like very few others.

Part of its lasting allure has to do with the fact that its author — Lauryn Hill, who’d also win the best new artist Grammy on the back of this debut recording – has really never released a proper follow-up to “Miseducation.”



 

Yes, there was a live album in 2002, plus a few singles. But, as befuddling as it may sound, her most recent studio recording of original material remains that 1998 debut.

I guess it’s hard to follow a near-perfect album. And that’s exactly what this hip-hop-soul great gave the world with “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,”  even if her career since then has been frustratingly inconsistent.

Hill and thousands of her devoted Bay Area fans will celebrate the milestone anniversary of her only studio album by performing “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” on Sept. 20 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre at Mountain View.

It should be fun to hear Hill deliver such key “Miseducation” cuts as “Doo Wop (That Thing),” “Ex-Factor” and “Everything Is Everything,” all of which were Top 40 singles.

Plus, Hill isn’t the evening’s only draw. The opening acts on this overall solid bill are SZA, De La Soul and Shabazz Palaces. So, in other words, try not to miss a second of the action.

Details: 6:30 p.m.; $31.50-$125; www.livenation.com.

	As Bordeaux is to wine, California’s cannabis seeks its own identity

					Pat Malo, executive director of a local cannabis-industry association, Green Trade Santa Cruz, poses for a photograph on Sept. 28, 2018, at the cultivation site of Sweet Water Creek collectives in Brookdale, Calif. (Dai Sugano/Bay Area News Group)

Only France can claim Champagne. Only Italy can raise Parma pigs. Only Brits can make Stilton cheese.
And soon Santa Cruz, Mendocino, Humboldt and California’s other weed-welcoming regions will be granted their own protected symbols of horticultural identity, as California drafts its version of Europe’s prestigious “Appellation d’Origine Controlee” – establishing rules that guarantee cannabis carrying that region’s name was grown in a specific place, using specific methods. 


The first place in the world to offer such designations, California aims to give small traditional growers an edge in the fiercely competitive free market – and give consumers the assurance that their $320 ounce of Big Sur Holy Bud grew up among rugged beauty and bohemian vibes and not, say, in some San Fernando Valley warehouse.
“We’re doing something new and innovative,” said Keir Furey of the California Department of Food and Agriculture. At a recent workshop at the Monterey Conference Center, button-down bureaucrats met the weathered Birkenstock crowd to discuss future rules, put in place by Jan. 1, 2021. “We want to create something that will be as useful as possible,” he said.
Goji OG, which has been one of the marijuana strains cultivated in Santa Cruz mountains for the last decade, is photographed on Sept. 28, 2018, at the cultivation site of Sweet Water Creek collectives in Brookdale, Calif. (Dai Sugano/Bay Area News Group) The effort is celebrated by the so-called “heritage growers” scattered across the rural regions of the state, who have labored for years in anonymity. Now, with legalization, they fear that outsiders will steal their name and lay claim to their coveted genetics, growing techniques and landscapes – then mass-produce cheap weed like a commodity.
Location has always been key to the cannabis ethos, central to its outlaw romance. If protected from impostors and wannabes, growers say, their brands could rise in status, reflecting the state’s most coveted growing regions: Santa Cruz, Carmel Valley, Big Sur, as well as the “Emerald Triangle” counties of Mendocino, Humboldt and Trinity. Although growers throughout the state are invited to apply, not everyone will meet eligibility criteria, keeping much of the state’s cannabis generic.
Just as Santa Cruz and Monterey vineyards are known for their distinctive wines, those regions’ weed savants take pride in their harvests of Goji OG and Gorilla Glue #4, reciting maturation times, buzz properties, fragrance, color and breeding-lineage descriptions (e.g., “sativa-sativa-dominant hybrid bred by Bodhi Seeds, backcrossing Nepali OG x Snow Lotus.”)
On a recent tour, a Santa Cruz Mountains farmer showed off techniques perfected by 47 years of growing. His lush emerald-colored gardens are a horticultural Xanadu, fastidious and full of preening beauty and glittery glow. Eight feet tall, his plants are nurtured by local water, organic fertilizer, protective insects, crisp air and a sun that climbs over redwood forests then sweeps across crisp and clear blue skies.
Such growers have studied the constant ebb and flow of cool and warm air, matching strains to idiosyncratic spots of fog and sun. The mountains’ eastern gardens are hot and dry; western gardens are cooler and moist. In canyons, rain can pour down in torrents. Ridgelines are parched and sun-baked.
Some soils are hospitable and well-drained limestone; others are less fertile, such as the Franciscan shale. Along the southern Big Sur coast, there’s lime; in northern Big Sur, soils are more granitic. Local soil bacteria and fungus vary as well, they say.
“We have unique microclimates, varying from ridge to ridge, with pockets and bowls,” said Harmony D’Angelo, lithe with long honey-hued hair. A second generation grower who grew up fearing the buzz of government helicopters, she now works with Monterey County officials to create pilot cannabis projects for the Big Sur Farmers Association.
There’s regional lore. Central California’s introduction to cannabis happened here, say local growers, when seeds from Mexico were brought to the Santa Lucia Mountains above Big Sur, then improved upon by hippies living on isolated tracts of land with no electricity, plumbing or roads. Celebrated in raucous “harvest parties” on bluffs overlooking the Pacific, our weed eventually found its way to Maui, Northern California, Amsterdam, and beyond.
“Specific regions of California have a long history and heritage of craft cannabis production,” said Pat Malo, executive director of the Santa Cruz-based Green Trade, a cannabis collective. “There’s also a history of the genetics, with different famous strains passing through different regions at different times. And people farming in their special ways.”
Is it possible to discern all that from a couple hits of a joint?
The cultivation site of Sweet Water Creek collectives uses no pesticide and releases predatory insects to control unwanted pests. (Dai Sugano/Bay Area News Group) A recent study found that 45 percent of cannabis customers can’t name a single preferred strain. “In general, cannabis users just don’t have the level of loyalty or commitment you might expect,” said Mike Luce of High Yield Insights, which conducted the research.
Meanwhile, prices are plummeting as a ”green rush” of entrepreneurs, investors and growers from around the world build sprawling multi-million dollar greenhouse complexes in Salinas, Carpinteria, Desert Hot Springs and elsewhere.
But just as California introduced yoga, organic food and meditation into mainstream culture, the appellation system could create a buzz around boutique brands, say growers.
“Consumers know they’re buying into your value system,” said Big Sur grower Oliver Bates, who’s seeking approval for 50 plants at his mountain home, overlooking the Pacific. “Environmentalism. Conservancy. Supporting the legacy growers, who have worked for generations on beautiful treasures.”
It would help growers differentiate their brands, said Malo. “I see this as the only chance that these historic producers have to stay competitive in the market,” he said.
The process is mandated by state law, which requires the California Department of Food and Agriculture to create a process for state-licensed cultivators to petition for an appellation. There currently are “county-of-origin” requirements, if 100 percent of the cannabis is produced within a designated county. But appellations go much farther, allowing growers to create areas within or beyond counties — and to create specific requirements for how cannabis is grown there.
The marijuana cultivation site of Sweet Water Creek collectives is photographed on Sept. 28, 2018, in Brookdale, Calif. (Dai Sugano/Bay Area News Group) Mendocino has already mapped out 11 distinct cannabis appellation regions. The borders don’t follow geographic lines, but gravitate around watersheds and tight-knit growing communities like Anderson Valley, Potter Valley and Bell Springs, according to Justin Calvino, executive director of Terroir Mendocino. He worked with a local attorney who assisted vintners, grape-growers and policy makers with the creation of an appellations system for the Napa Valley.
Santa Cruz and Monterey County growers hope to follow suit, eventually creating a patchwork of small and distinctive appellations — Bonny Doon, Corralitos, Brookdale, Ben Lomond, Carmel Valley and beyond — that reflect the region’s laid-back bohème.
“Someone here could make their little farm world famous — in a world-famous appellation, that’s in a world-famous county, that’s in a world-famous state,” said Malo.

LATEST RESULTS

Warriors: Defeated Oklahoma City 111-107 on Tuesday night. Kevin Durant had 34 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. The Thunder’s Russell Westbrook had 44 points, including 17 during his unstoppable third quarter. He also had 16 rebounds and six assists.

Pacers: Lost to Denver 107-104 on Tuesday night at the Pepsi Center, ending a five-game winning streak. The Pacers have not won in Denver since Nov. 27, 2007. 

PREVIOUS MEETING

The teams have met once this season, with Indiana winning 92-81 on March 27 at Oracle Arena. Offensively challenged Golden State led 48-39 at halftime, but could muster only 33 points in the second half, including 11 in the fourth quarter. The Warriors played without All-Stars Stephen Curry (left knee), Kevin Durant (ribs), Klay Thompson (broken right thumb) and Draymond Green (flu). 

MATCHUP TO WATCH

The Warriors’ Klay Thompson vs. Any Pacer Who Tries to Defend Him: Not that anyone is happy about a player being hurt — even an opponent — but the Pacers must have been relieved to not see Thompson in Oakland last week. He was out because of a broken right thumb. The last time Indiana faced Thompson was on Dec. 5, 2016 at Oracle Arena. On that night, Thompson scored a career-high 60 points in only 29 minutes as the Warriors won 142-106. Thompson was so hot that he had two 20-point quarters — 23 in the second and 20 in the third. He did not play in the fourth. In six games over the past three seasons, Thompson has torched the Pacers for 39 points or more four times. He has averaged 38.5 points on 53.9-percent shooting and 50.0 percent (37 of 74) on 3-pointers. 

INJURY UPDATE

Curry is out for the rest of the regular season and probably the start of the playoffs because of a Grade 2 sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his left knee. Patrick McCaw suffered a lumbar spine contusion on a scary fall on Saturday in Sacramento. He is not on this two-game trip to Oklahoma City and Indiana. Andre Iguodala (sore left knee) has missed the past three games and is out tonight. Kevon Looney, who missed the Oklahoma City game because of flu symptoms, will play. Omri Casspi (sprained right ankle) is not on this trip and will miss his 10th consecutive game. Nick Young (flu) is questionable. 

GOING DEEP INTO THE BENCH

Without Iguodala, Looney, McCaw and Casspi, plus the absence of Shaun Livingston for personal reasons, Golden State still managed to get decent production from its depleted bench at Oklahoma City. Five reserves combined for 38 points against the Thunder.

G LEAGUE CONTRIBUTION

Warriors backup center Damian Jones played the best game of his limited NBA career Tuesday night. And it wasn’t just Jones’ statistics — eight points, three rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot in 13:44 — that were impressive. It’s when he compiled them. He saw early action, playing 6:58 in the second quarter. He also came back and played 5:38 late in the fourth quarter. And those were actual meaningful minutes in a tight game, not garbage time. 

POINT TO PROVE?

Durant did some major damage to his former team Tuesday night. He kept the Warriors alive in the first quarter when he scored 15 of Golden State’s 24 points and wound up with 24 in the first half on his way to team-high 34. But then again, this is what he routinely does to Oklahoma City. In seven games against the Thunder over the past two seasons, Durant is averaging 32.7 points and shooting 54.7 percent from the field, 51.9 percent on 3-pointers and 94.5 percent from the free-throw line. 

PLENTY AT STAKE

The Pacers (46-32) still have a shot at challenging No. 4 Philadelphia (48-30) for homecourt advantage in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. If only the 76ers would lose a game. Despite winning three of four on their just-completed Western trip, the Pacers have lost ground as the 76ers have reeled off 12 consecutive victories. No. 3 Cleveland (48-30 with the tiebreaker advantage over the 76ers) has also been hot, winning four in a row and nine of 10. 

RACE WITH THE RAPTORS

The Warriors are locked in a battle for homecourt advantage — with the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors (56-22) lead the Eastern Conference by three games over the Boston Celtics. The Warriors (57-21) are one game ahead of Toronto. At stake is homecourt advantage — if these teams wind up meeting in the NBA Finals. 

THIEF IN THE NIGHT

Pacers guard Victor Oladipo has recorded a steal in 61 consecutive games. He extended that streak with four steals Tuesday at Denver. For the season, Oladipo leads the NBA in steals with 2.33 per game. His streak is the sixth-longest in NBA history, but he has a ways to go to break the record. Chris Paul set the mark of 108 in 2008. Next on the list are Gary Payton at 63 and Mike Conley at 64.

CAN’T MISS

Durant can become the third player in NBA history to put together multiple 50-40-90 seasons — that is shooting 50 percent from the field, 40 percent on 3-pointers and 90 percent from the line. So far, Durant is shooting 51.7 percent from the field, 42.5 percent from long range and 89.0 percent from the line. But he will need to go at least 39 for 39 from the line for the rest of the season to reach 90.0 percent. Durant did his first 50-40-90 season in the 2012-13 (51.0, 41.6 and 90.5). The others to accomplish this feat more than once are Steve Nash (four times) and Larry Bird (twice). 

NO ROUNDING UP

Speaking of 50-40-90, Curry is going to fall short this season. He has the 3-point (42.3) and free-throw (92.1) percentages but shot 49.5 percent from the field.

AN ACHILLES’ HEEL

After limiting the Thunder to one offensive rebound in the first quarter, the Warriors yielded 21 over the next three quarters. In all, Oklahoma City scored 20 second-chance points. One of the reasons for all of those offensive rebounds? Opportunity. The Thunder shot only 37.6 percent. 

IN CASE YOU WONDERED

How did they come up with the name Indiana Pacers? One reason was to recognize the state’s harness racing heritage. Harness racing is where horses pull two-wheeled “sulkies” that carry the “driver” (not jockeys). The standardbred horses are either trotters or pacers. (Pacers, by the way, are the horses that are trained to run with the legs on each side of their bodies coordinated in unison.) The other reason for the Pacers name is because of the pace car for the Indianapolis 500.

Nearly 50 years ago, Sharon Wright drove her family’s cattle on horseback down Calaveras Road and into downtown Milpitas. Local police cleared the path from the family ranch in the San Jose foothills to the train depot.

Today, Milpitas has an outlet mall, growing suburbs and more than 5,000 tech employees working for Cisco and SanDisk. There are no more cattle drives.

“It makes me feel very old and sad,” said Wright, 67, one of three surviving children of Ernest and Bonnie Wool. “It’s changed so much.”

More change is ahead. The vast Wool family ranch, owned and worked by the same family for 100 years, is up for sale. Although the family will surrender title to the land they’ve hunted and tilled for generations, they will not give up its history.



Over the last several decades, families of many long-time farmers and ranchers have cashed in on multi-million dollar offers and moved out of the Bay Area. Recent years have brought record land prices.

But for the Wool family descendants — owners of roughly 800 acres of clear meadows, oak groves, wild game and expansive Bay views — the sale means the end of an era.

“This has kind of been the center point for the family,” said Bart Wool, 64, who lives on an adjacent property that’s also being sold. “We used to be a lot tighter.”

Wool Ranch is unusual in many ways — few family parcels have survived generations without being whittled down to small properties by descendants. And real estate agents say rarely will such a large tract be put up for sale in the Bay Area. Roughly 767 acres of the ranch is listed for $13.9 million, while an adjacent 20-acre parcel is priced at $1 million.

					
				

The land is zoned for agriculture, preventing its development into new tracts of housing.

Todd Renfrew, broker for the property, said it could be developed as a small estate with a ranch and stables, an oasis amidst the sprawling region. “You’re surrounded by hundreds of acres,” he said. “It’s a one-of-kind property.”

Local land trusts and government agencies with adjacent land have not expressed interest in the property, he said.



Paul Bernal, a local historian as well as a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge, said Wool Ranch is one of a few holdouts.

“In an area where most people move every 10 years or so, and the bank owns their home,” Bernal wrote in an email, “it is unusual for a family to own a large estate for about 100 years.”

Wool Ranch sits between Mission Peak Regional Preserve and Sunol Regional Wilderness. It was originally part of Rancho Los Tularcitos, an early 19th century Spanish land grant.

E.O. Wool bought the property off Weller Road in Alameda County near Milpitas in 1919, having grown up in the area. His father, Fred Wool, founded F.G. Wool Packing Co. in San Jose, a business that survived until 1989 as one of the last family owned and operated canneries in the city.

E.O. was known as “Sandy” for his light complexion and red hair. The family grew walnuts, tomatoes, prunes and other fruits and took them to the family cannery for packing. Sandy Wool rose in local politics, serving on the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors between 1937 and 1953. The county named a lake after him in Ed R. Levin Park.

The property passed along to his son, Ernest, after Sandy Wool died in 1968. Ernest Wool built a private indoor horse arena, one of the first in the state, and boarded horses at their Diamond W Stable. The Wools raised three boys and a girl on the property.

As a young girl, Wright took to the saddle and endlessly rode the property. Her brothers hunted and fished with their father. An uncle, Al Wool, filmed a nature documentary on the land.

They held family reunions in the pastures, swam in the cow ponds and galloped across the fields with wild horses. As kids, Wright said, “we were always in someplace we shouldn’t be.”

“It was a nice way to grow up,” her brother added.

About a decade ago, Ernest Wool, fearing a messy family dispute over his estate, listed the property for sale, family members said. But a solid offer never arrived. Wool died in 2015, leaving the multi-million dollar property to his four surviving and sometimes disputatious children.

The children deadlocked on whether to sell parts of the land, keep parts, or grant smaller parcels to the survivors. They ended up in court, and a mediator decided the distribution of the estate. The ranch was put back on the market this spring.

The eldest son, Jeff of San Jose, died in June. A third brother, Scott, declined to comment.

“If we’d have thought more alike, we could’ve had a dynasty,” Bart Wool said, “instead of a tragedy.”

The horse stables property, which includes a few houses and a barn, is under contract to be sold for about $2.7 million. It’s expected to become a religious retreat.

A few prospective buyers have toured Wool Ranch, including a tech executive and a group of foreign investors. The sale will bring in millions, but the brother and sister don’t see it as a lottery ticket.

Wool doesn’t know where he will move. He wants to make sure his two sons are settled. He’s grown tired of the “rude and impolite” traffic in the Bay Area.

Wool may join his sister in Shasta County. Wright moved from Santa Maria to a cattle ranch in Cottonwood, south of Redding. She hopes to buy a small ranch and stay a cowgirl.
“When you’re young,” Wool said, “you think things aren’t going to change.”

Wright agreed: “None of us were quite ready.”

PUBLISHED: September 22, 2018 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: September 24, 2018 at 7:21 am


MARTINEZ — The fate of an Antioch man accused of murdering his father for insurance money was sent to a Contra Costa County jury Thursday, culminating a month of testimony that put the victim and defendant’s home life in the spotlight.

The prosecution painted defendant Scott Eastman, 24, as a conniving aspiring drug dealer who purchased narcotics through the Dark Web and plotted for months to kill his father, 43-year-old Relis Eastman, using apps that mask internet activity to solicit the purchase of the revolver and ammunition used in the killing.

But the defense contended Scott Eastman loved his father and was set up by his stepmother, who set up an alibi for herself and left him to take the blame.

“Scott Eastman is not a murderer,” deputy public defender Julian Ross told jurors Thursday, his voice rising. He later added, “Scott Eastman would help his family. He didn’t hurt them.”

Throughout the trial, much of the focus has been on the victim, Relis Eastman, who was found shot in the head at his home in Antioch on June 25, 2016. It appeared to police the shooter sneaked up behind him. Though Eastman survived the initial attack, he was declared brain dead that night and never regained consciousness. He died five days later.

Scott Eastman was arrested and charged after Relis Eastman’s death following multiple police interviews and a scan of a phone he disposed of the night of the killing. Prosecutors say for months he researched the very type of ammunition used in the killing, but police never recovered the murder weapon.

Weeks before Relis Eastman was shot, the family had a meeting where his life insurance policy was discussed, prosecutor Alison Chandler said, adding that Scott Eastman told others he thought he would be the sole beneficiary.

“He had plans. His dad was in the way,” Chandler said. “If he could get rid of Relis, he could not only sell drugs and get away with it, he’d have insurance money.”

Members of the Eastman family testified throughout the trial, including Relis Eastman’s then-9-year-old stepson who found his bloody, unconscious body in the kitchen of their home. It was initially assumed Eastman had slipped and hit his head in the kitchen, until police noticed a gunshot wound.

					
				

Relis Eastman’s ex-wife — Scott Eastman’s stepmother — also testified, but only after signing an agreement that guaranteed she would be immune from any incriminating statements she made on the stand.

During the start of her closing argument Wednesday, Chandler said an unfair portrait of Relis Eastman had been painted during trial.

“The evidence shows he’s a good man,” Chandler said. “He worked for AT&T. He’s an Army veteran. He’s trying to raise his kids.”

‘He trying to kill me’

The Eastman family had an unusual living situation; Relis and Scott Eastman’s stepmother lived in separate rooms and were not romantically involved, though they were formerly married and shared children. Scott Eastman’s three sisters and younger brother also lived at the small home on Biglow Drive.

Scott Eastman, then in his early 20s, lived at the home, too, and slept in a family room on a couch.

Months before Relis Eastman’s death, he went on disability leave from his job at AT&T and started spending a lot more time at home. According to testimony from family members, he was seen by others as a bit of a nag. His ex-wife described him as “controlling” and “dependent” on her, and testified he once told her he would sabotage any friendships she made.

Other members of the family would text each other about when he wasn’t in the house. He and his ex-wife would argue multiple times a week. Relis was hardest on Scott, who he wanted to get a job and move out, according to the testimony. He imposed a curfew on his adult son, saying he needed to have his silver Volkswagen bug back at a certain time every day.

At some point, Scott Eastman began ordering drugs from the Dark Web, including prescription pills, ecstasy and hallucinogens. One of the packages was intercepted by Relis Eastman, who was enraged his son would order drugs to the home. He wanted to kick Scott Eastman out, but his stepmother took Scott’s side.

“It was none of our business,” she said on the stand in August. “We wouldn’t want him to take our mail.”

One day, Eastman’s stepmother said, she came home to find Relis “ranting.”

“(Relis) kept saying, ‘He’s trying to kill me,’ ” the woman testified, referring to Scott Eastman. Chandler then asked her if Relis Eastman told her Scott Eastman had tried to smother him with a pillow, but Ross successfully objected to the question.

A series of strange events

The 24 hours leading up to Relis Eastman’s death saw one unusual happening after another. It started the day before, when Scott Eastman’s sister’s room was mysteriously ransacked. Scott later confided in his sister he did it because he was “looking for something,” his sister testified.

The day Relis Eastman was shot, members of the family were preparing for Scott Eastman’s stepbrother’s 10th birthday party. Scott’s stepmother spent the whole day going to various shopping centers, buying gifts and texting her ex-husband. Scott, meanwhile, was hanging out with friends and smoke a little pot.

According to Chandler, Scott Eastman made his move a few minutes before 9:15 that night, parking his car around the corner, going into his home and shooting his father in the head when he wasn’t expecting it.

Ross said the trajectory angle and the fact that Relis Eastman was several inches taller than his son disqualifies Scott Eastman as a suspect. He said Eastman did not have enough time to commit the murder.

After the killing, Scott Eastman’s stepmother arrived home with the kids, pulled up in front of the house, but then made an unusual move: rather than parking and going inside, she left, drove a couple of miles away to get gas, then returned and entered the house. She testified during trial her gas light went on just as she was pulling up.

Chandler admitted her account of the night was “weird,” but said there was “no way” the woman would allow her young son to find Relis Eastman’s body if she’d known in advance Relis was going to be shot.

“Even if you think maybe she had something to do with it, (Scott Eastman) is the killer,” Chandler said. “He’s the shooter.”

After Relis Eastman’s body was discovered, his ex-wife called 911. The tape was played in court as she testified.

“What do I do? Someone get me a paramedic,” she can be heard yelling on the tape. She repeats, “I don’t want to go in there, I don’t want to go in there.”

As the tape played, the woman began sobbing and hyperventilating on the stand. Near the end of her testimony Chandler asked her if she was involved in Relis Eastman’s death.

“No ma’am,” she replied. “I didn’t do anything.”

She also testified her lawyer had not shown her the immunity agreement she signed, and seemed unsure what it meant.

Jury deliberations are expected to continue on Monday.

	NASA probe begins 7-year mission to study sun and its dangers

By Sarah Kaplan and Ben Guarino
It was dark on Earth when NASA’s Parker Solar Probe launched on its journey to endless day. The first spacecraft designed to swoop by a star took flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 3:31 Sunday morning. A roaring Delta IV Heavy rocket carried the probe out of Earth’s atmosphere. Next stop: A loop past Venus to rendezvous with the sun.


The source of all light and life on Earth is also the source of one of its biggest natural threats: space weather. The sun’s atmosphere regularly erupts with fast-moving flashes of protons and explosions of energetic particles that can hit Earth within minutes and disrupt radio communication, interfere with GPS, and fry the electric grid. A “worst-case scenario” space weather event could cause more damage than Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey and Sandy combined.

“It sounds like science fiction,” said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist William Murtagh, who heads the Space Weather Prediction Center. “But it’s something that’s not only possible but very likely to happen in the not-too-distant future.”
Scientists have long struggled to understand and predict space weather events, because the ferocious environment around the sun makes them difficult to witness as they form.
Murtagh and scores of other researchers watched as NASA’s newest spacecraft embarked on a mission that should take it closer to the sun than any human-made object has gone before.
The probe is the culmination of a half-century effort to understand our star, Murtagh says, and it may help us prepare for the hazards the sun may throw at us in the future.
Part of the sun erupted on Sept. 1, 1859. English astronomer Richard Carrington noticed a brilliant white solar flare on the sun, brighter than the sunspots he usually observed. Roughly a day later, a blast of charged particles — known as a coronal mass ejection, or CME — arrived at Earth, jostling the planet’s magnetic bubble. People as far south as Cuba saw the sky light up with auroras. Geomagnetic currents sent surges of electricity through copper telegraph wires, zapping operators and setting telegraph paper aflame.
If a similar event happened today, it would bring life as we know it to a halt.
The energetic particles within a coronal mass ejection can penetrate the walls of spacecraft and pose a radiation risk to astronauts and the technology they depend on. They can interfere with satellites, disrupting radio communication and GPS. And if a CME hits our planet’s magnetosphere at the right angle, it can generate powerful waves of electricity within the Earth. These may then infiltrate utility grids and blow out transformers that provide electricity — like tripping a circuit on a massive scale.
The sun exploded again in July 2012, spewing material toward Earth at nearly 6 million miles per hour. This time the coronal mass ejection hit a NASA spacecraft called STEREO-A at full-blast. The spacecraft’s sensors were stressed, but they still managed to measure the solar particles, gusts of solar wind and the strength of the interplanetary magnetic field.
A year after the explosion, in a paper published in the journal Space Weather, astrophysicists examined the STEREO-A data to answer a worst-case question. “What if that coronal mass ejection had occurred 10 days earlier, when the Earth was in the line of fire?” said Daniel Baker, a professor of planetary and space physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder and one of the authors of the study.
Their conclusion: If it had hit Earth, Baker and his colleagues wrote, there was a “very legitimate question of whether our society would still be ‘picking up the pieces.'”
In 2008, a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report on the economic and societal impacts of space weather came up with a worst-case estimate for an extreme geomagnetic storm: It could cost North America up to $2 trillion in the first year, and recovery would take four to 10 years.
It’s said that space weather science lags about 50 years behind terrestrial weather forecasting. Meteorologists know what conditions cause hurricanes, and they can spot the seeds of a storm brewing over the ocean long before it makes landfall.
But warning times for space weather events are often measured in minutes, Murtagh said, and there is too much we do not know.
“There’s a lack of understanding,” Murtagh said. “It’s science. It’s knowledge of the sun and the physical processes that are likely to produce those energetic particles. We just don’t fully understand the science yet.”
Much of our modern understanding of the sun stems from 91-year-old Eugene Parker, for whom NASA’s new probe is named.
In the mid-1950s, Parker discovered a link between two seemingly unrelated space mysteries. First, bizarrely, the corona, or atmosphere of the sun, is hotter than its surface — scientists liken the sun to a campfire that feels hotter the further one stands from the flames. And second, the dusty tails of comets always point away from the sun, as if blasted by a powerful wind.
Parker realized the corona is not a static halo, but a stream of material from the sun itself. It starts slow and dense and zooms up as it escapes the sun’s gravity, eventually exceeding the speed of sound. The pointed tails of comets behave like windsocks caught in the solar wind.
The acceleration of the particles in the solar wind remains one of the “fundamental mysteries of the sun,” said Nicola Fox, a heliophysicist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and the project scientist for Parker Solar Probe. And it is one of the keys to understanding CMEs — the blasts that pose so much danger to life on Earth.
After the National Academies released its sobering 2008 report, “awareness, both at government and in the public, for this hazard really came to the fore,” said a Federal Emergency Management Agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Trillion-dollar space storms are a rare issue that rallies Republicans and Democrats alike. The Obama administration’s executive order 13744 created a national space weather policy in 2016. FEMA recently finished drafting a federal operations plan for space weather that was sent to the Trump administration for approval. Congress is also considering legislation directing funds toward developing a space weather plan.
The issue is particularly pressing for the East Coast of the United States between Washington and Maine, not only because of the extensive electric infrastructure in this region. The 300 million-year-old igneous rock on which the Eastern Seaboard is perched does not conduct electricity well. If a current strikes this rock, it will seek an easier path — like metal pipes, telephone wires and electric cables. Eventually, the current can hit high-voltage transformers, the spine of the power grid, and overwhelm their magnetic cores.
This is not idle speculation. It happened, on a relatively small scale, in Canada in 1989. The sun belched out a gas cloud in early March that cut off radio signals. (At first, some observers suspected Soviet, not solar, interference.) Electrical currents buzzed through the ground and flooded into the Hydro-Québec power plant. Six million people in Québec were without power for nine hours. Glancing effects were felt as far away as New Jersey, where the electrical surge roasted a transformer at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant.
Industry reports suggest operators would have enough time to shut down the grid before it suffered permanent damage. But others are not as optimistic.
“We’re not going to know until a real event happens whether or not that’s a true statement,” said the FEMA official, who added power utility engineers “won’t say this publicly,” but they have been stocking up on spare transformers where they can. Installing new transformers — which would have to be built overseas — might take one or two years.
That a future solar storm will blast Earth is not a question of if, but when. In 2012, Peter Riley, who studies the sun’s corona at Predictive Science Inc., a San Diego-based company that develops computer models of the sun, published an article in Space Weather that calculated the odds of a Carrington-scale repeat. Within the next decade, he concluded, it could be about 12 percent — on par with the risk of other 100-year hazards, like massive floods.
Over the next seven years, the Parker Solar Probe will embark on a series of 24 egg-shaped orbits around the sun, repeatedly swinging past Venus to reorient itself. Each close approach will shoot it through the corona at a breathtaking 450,000 miles per hour – fast enough to get from Washington to New York in about a second. With its dust detectors, particle counters, and a telescope that can take 3-D images of the corona, the probe will measure the sun’s electric and magnetic fields, scoop particles from the solar wind for sampling and watch as shocks travel out from the sun’s surface, through the atmosphere and into space.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that measurements from probe and our understanding is going to have a huge impact on our ability to predict space weather,” said Christina Cohen, a scientist at the California Institute of Technology’s Space Radiation Lab who studies energetic particles.It is a project scientists have dreamed about for roughly as long as they have known about the solar wind. But it took half a century to develop the necessary technology. When the spacecraft makes its first close approach in November, a carbon-composite heat shield will be all that protects the minivan-sized Parker Solar Probe from the million-mile-wide ball of hot gas.
Parker was interviewed on NASA-TV shortly after witnessing the launch of the probe that bears his name. “All I can say is, wow, here we go,” he said. “We’re in for some learning over the next several years.”

It’s become almost a summer tradition in the California Capitol. 

As basketball season hits its final buzzer and baseball season gets into full swing, it’s also peak deal-making season for legislators rushing toward their August adjournment. Now is when professional sports teams hoping to build new stadiums staff up with Sacramento lobbyists, typically seeking to speed up construction of their new digs by persuading lawmakers to grant them exceptions from state environmental rules. 

 
Lawmakers are considering two such proposals this summer — one to help the Los Angeles Clippers build an arena in Inglewood, another to help the Oakland A’s construct a stadium in Oakland. 

They’re the latest in a long string of legislation to assist professional sports teams. In the last decade, lawmakers passed bills that fast-tracked new venues for the Sacramento Kings, Golden State Warriors and San Francisco 49ers. They also approved bills meant to help build new football stadiums in Los Angeles and San Diego that never came to pass. 

The proposals routinely stir up debate over California’s environmental laws and whether to grant special deals for wealthy sports franchises. Making the debate even more poignant now: A lag in home construction has contributed to skyrocketing rents and increasing homelessness. Though lawmakers have taken steps to speed up projects that include homes for low-income residents, they have not granted housing developments the same favored treatment they’ve given sports teams. 

“It’s bad to have two systems of law — one for rich people and one for everybody else. And that’s what we’re seeing,” said David Pettit, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that fought a bill last year to waive some environmental rules for a new Clippers arena. 

At the heart of the debate is the California Environmental Quality Act, a nearly 50-year-old law that some see as a sacrosanct protection and others as an excuse for lawsuits that drag on so long they doom ambitious projects. 

With environmentalists staunchly against loosening its requirements, Democrats who control the Legislature have resisted making sweeping changes to the act. Instead, they’ve approved a series of one-off arrangements to help individual teams by: expanding the use of eminent domain to acquire land, making it harder for courts to delay construction, or limiting the length of time for resolving environmental lawsuits. They even passed a law in 2011 entitling big projects to expedite environmental lawsuits under certain conditions, but teams continue to seek special deals for broader relief. 

Lawmakers don’t always approve them. Last year they shot down the Clippers’ request — but it was unusual because moneyed interests were lobbying on both sides. Owners of the Forum, a nearby concert arena, lobbied hard against the Clippers. The dueling interests combined spent more than $1 million lobbying on the bill, and owners of the Forum aired commercials attacking the state senator who carried it. A few months after Forum owners killed the bill, they showered legislators with $45,000 in campaign contributions. 

					
				

Assemblywoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Los Angeles, carrying this year’s version of the Clippers bill, said she expects another tense fight. The Clippers want to build their arena about a mile from the Forum, creating competition for big events. 

“With so much money on the line,”  she said, “I can only suspect that they’re going to pull out the stops to defeat this.” 

Opponents of the Clippers arena point out that the team’s proposal would impact much more than construction of the arena alone, which would cover just one-sixth of the land for the entire development project. They say it could allow stores, offices or homes to be built on the site without the normal environmental review — even if an arena is never constructed. 

Kamlager-Dove and other supporters of big sports projects cast them as economic boosts to their communities, bringing construction jobs during the building phase and concessions jobs afterward. These benefits can be lost or delayed, they say, by environmental litigation. The Clippers and A’s bills this year would limit the timeline for environmental lawsuits to nine months. 

That’s a critical perk for developing a new Oakland A’s stadium with surrounding shops and homes, said Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda, carrying the bill for his hometown team. 

“They can’t allow the project to be delayed forever. They need some certainty,” he said. “This is not something to benefit rich and powerful folks. It’s to benefit a community that needs housing, that needs good jobs.” 

The courts have argued that limiting the time to review environmental lawsuits unfairly puts those cases at the top of the heap, denying ordinary Californians equal access to justice. 

“A case involving elder abuse or asbestos litigation involving dying plaintiffs would move back in the line. A personal injury action involving a severely brain-damaged child, whose parents are simply seeking to get their recovery to take care of that child, would move back in line. And there are not lobbying groups that come to this Legislature to represent those interests,” Dan Pone, a lobbyist for the Judicial Council, said at a hearing earlier this year. 

Lawmakers approved the nine-month limit for the Kings and Warriors arenas, but this year rejected applying it challenges over community plans and construction of new housing. 

And yet they approved a bill as part of the state budget that would place the nine-month limit on environmental lawsuits over a project close to home: a $1.2 billion re-make of their Capitol offices.

Sen. Steve Glazer, D-Orinda, who carried the bill to expedite court review of environmental lawsuits over housing that was shot down by fellow Democrats, called out the irony in a hearing this week: 
“And now we have here… this expedited process not for billionaires and their stadium projects, but for us, the politicians, and our own building. So where does that help us on our issues of affordable housing, when we’re going to provide that fast-track for us but not for everybody else, except for the wealthiest and the most powerful?”

By Amanda Coletta | Washington Post

TORONTO – With two months to go before recreational cannabis is legalized in Canada on Oct. 17, new data from the country’s national statistics agency is stoking fears about drugged driving and raising questions about the ability of law enforcement officials to detect impairment.

According to Statistics Canada data released last week, 1 in 7 cannabis users with a valid driver’s license has hopped behind the wheel within two hours of consuming the drug at least once within the past three months.

Other surveys from Health Canada and Public Safety Canada in 2017 also revealed that large percentages of Canadians are driving after consuming marijuana. In fact, 1 in 10 respondents of the latter survey said they believed cannabis makes a person “a more careful driver” – a conviction refuted by science.

But while Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada described the Statistics Canada numbers as “alarming,” others say the survey data tells only part of the story since it does not indicate that those who drove after smoking were actually impaired.

Identifying marijuana impairment is a major issue that has beguiled Canadian lawmakers since the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first introduced legislation to legalize the drug in April 2017.

Their attempt to do so is represented by Bill C-46, which overhauled Canada’s impaired driving laws. Under the legislation, drivers with two to five nanograms of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis – per milliliter of blood will face charges, which could result in hefty fines. Drivers exceeding the five-nanogram limit, or with both THC and alcohol in their systems, will face stiffer penalties, including up to 10 years in prison.

The problem, according to Rob De Luca, the director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s public safety programs, is “that the link between THC levels and impairment is quite loose.”

					
				

Cannabis is unlike alcohol, which can be easily and accurately measured by a person’s blood alcohol content levels, experts say. Cannabis metabolizes differently, and factors ranging from body fat levels to personal history with the drug to how it was ingested affect whether a driver is impaired by it.

“Peak impairment does not occur when THC concentration in the blood is at or near peak levels,” a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report to Congress in 2017 found. “In contrast to the situation with alcohol, someone can show little or no impairment at a THC level at which someone else may show a greater degree of impairment.”

An annex to Bill C-46 made the same point, noting, “the science is unable to provide general guidance to drivers about how much cannabis can be consumed before it is unsafe to drive or before the proposed levels would be exceeded.”

Habitual users of the drug and those who ingest it for medicinal purposes are likely to have high THC levels days or even weeks after they last consumed marijuana and long after experiencing its psychoactive effects, De Luca said. Some studies show that even people exposed to second-hand marijuana smoke can test positive for THC.

“There is a very real danger that someone who is not impaired will get caught up in the criminal justice system,” said De Luca, who anticipates Bill C-46 will face a barrage of legal challenges.

Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould defended the rules earlier this year. “Until we have definitive scientific evidence around what is a safe level, we’re proceeding on a precautionary basis, saying there is no safe level,” she told the Globe and Mail.

Bill C-46 also grants police officers with reasonable suspicion that a driver is impaired new powers to administer roadside saliva tests, which determine whether a specific drug may be present in a driver’s system. The results are not admissible in court, but failing a test will spur arrest and further examinations at a police station.

Experts say that these tests and the devices used to carry them out are also riddled with problems. The NHTSA report found that “the accuracy and reliability of these devices has not yet been clearly established.”

A bill that would allow police in Vermont to use roadside saliva tests failed earlier this year because of these concerns.

Questions also have been raised about the ability of the devices, which require internal temperatures of at least 4 degrees Celsius (about 39 degrees Fahrenheit) to work, to function given Canada’s climate. A Public Safety Canada pilot study that tested some of these devices found that in 17 percent of cases where the device malfunctioned, temperature was responsible.

De Luca said the federal government should focus more on training drug-recognition experts – officers with specialized training to spot impaired drivers – than on THC limits.
Last month, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police said that it is unlikely to reach its goal of having 2,000 trained drug-recognition experts when cannabis becomes legal in October.

						A screen shot of Netflix programs such as Marvel’s “Daredevil” is seen in this image provided by the company. Cable TV giant Comcast is starting to bundle Netflix into some of it TV channel packages.		
	
By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: April 16, 2018 at 9:20 am | UPDATED: April 16, 2018 at 9:43 am


As the methods for watching TV continue to evolve, cable providers are taking new avenues to try to keep their customers and keep them from “cutting the cord.”

For example, for two years, cable TV giant Comcast has given subscribers to its X1 platform access to Netflix. You can even say the voice command “Go to Netflix” into your Comcast Xfinity remote and get taken straight to your Netflix account.

Now, Comcast is tying itself even closer to Netflix. The cable giant has announced that beginning this month, it will start bundling Netflix into some of its cable-TV packages for both new and current subscribers.

A few details remain unknown. Comcast hasn’t said which TV packages will have the Netflix option included, and that “offers and availability will vary by market.” The concept behind Comcast including Netflix in its TV bundles is two-fold.

First, Comcast will handle customers’s Netflix bills. If you’re a Comcast subscriber who also subscribes to Netflix, the $10.99 a month you currently pay to Netflix will be paid as part of your monthly Comcast bill. So, with Netflix included in your Comcast statement, you’ll have one less bill to keep track of every month.

But for Comcast, adding Netflix to its TV offerings is a way to keep customers within its TV-subscription universe. In January, Comcast said it ended 2017 with 21.3 million residential “video” subscribers, which was down by 186,000 subscribers from 2016.

Netflix, which reports its first-quarter results after Monday’s stock-market close, has almost 55 million subscribers in the United States, but the occasional quarter of slow subscriber growth has at times raised concerns about how much further Netflix can expand in its largest business market.

“This is a big win for Netflix, which could use the Comcast platform to boost its subscriber growth in the U.S. market,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst with Investing.com. “This is an especially timely move as domestic subscriptions have shown some signs of peaking, making some investors nervous.”
					
				

Even with cord-cutting going on, there can be no doubt that millions of those Netflix subscribers also subscribe to Comcast. And giving them even the simplest reason to stay with its service may be helpful to Comcast’s overall TV business.

By Kantele Franko | Associated Press

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Teachers unions are hoping that recent grass-roots protests over pay and working conditions will blunt the impact of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on union fees and help persuade dues-paying members not to abandon them.

The court said in a 5-4 ruling Wednesday that government workers can no longer be required to pay fees to labor organizations that represent them in collective bargaining.

The non-members paying those fees are only a small portion of the people represented by teachers unions, which are more concerned about a potentially bigger financial blow if members decide to opt out and join those who benefit from the bargaining representation without having to pay for it.

That leaves unions fighting to prove their worth and relevance.

“There has been an interesting surge in union militancy and strikes, whether we look at the West Virginia teachers, the Tennessee teachers, all of those teachers strikes this past spring occurred in right to work states, where supposedly unions were not strong. And those were some of the largest movements of workers that we’ve seen in a long time,” said Ileen DeVault, a Cornell University professor of labor history and director of The Worker Institute at Cornell.

“I think the inequality in our country has reached a point where people really can’t stand for it going any lower. Even Republicans may learn why it was better to have unions rather than to have people out in the streets on strike,” she said.

The court’s ruling provides “a powerful opportunity for union leaders to hit the reset button,” said Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and policy group.

					
				

“Union leaders in this sector have too often confused their protection and advocacy for some members with their obligation to the profession at large,” she said.

The teachers unions hope the successful protests will blunt the impact of the court’s ruling.

The head of the largest teachers union, National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen Garcia, said the demonstrations helped recruit new members and illustrate the power of a collective voice.

“I think there are a whole lot of people paying attention now that maybe weren’t paying attention before,” she said.

She and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten accused the high court of siding with wealthy business interests over the working class and emphasized their unions aren’t going anywhere.

But supporters of the ruling hailed it as a victory for non-union employees who object to paying unions that might be advocating for political causes with which they disagree.

“Public sector unions will now have to prioritize how they spend their funds without the revenue stream of nonmembers’ compelled agency fees,” said Elizabeth Slattery of the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation.

The teachers unions have been bracing for the court’s decision since it split 4-4 when it considered the issue in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Like other public-sector unions, they say they’ve tried to be extra-attentive to member concerns and boost one-on-one communication with members, making a case for the value of unions in anticipation of an increased push by opponents of organized labor to pressure members to leave.

“That’s where our concern comes in,” said Melissa Cropper, president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers. “When people start getting social media ads, getting things in their mail, getting people knocking on their door saying, ‘Give yourself a raise. Don’t pay your union dues anymore,’ what impact will that have on our membership?”

Unions can only guess to what extent the ruling might dent their funding, services and political advocacy. They argue it should be a matter of public interest because unions bargain not only issues like teachers’ wages and benefits but also class sizes and other elements that affect students’ learning environments.
“When you see attacks on unions, that can have an impact on what’s happening in the classroom, and that’s what should be concerning to people,” Cropper said.

In the short term, unions will lose some resources, members and maybe even staff, making it hard for them to be effective, said Robert Bruno, a professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

He said the long-term impact — whether it be shrinking union membership or a resurgence and more activism — depends on how unions have prepared for and react to this shift, and whether teachers in collective-bargaining states can preserve other industry-related public policies, such as the ability to bargain health insurance or pensions.

If unions weaken and working conditions worsen, educators may look for ways to fight back, whether it’s at the bargaining table or in public demonstrations to state governments, Bruno said.

“They will stand and take a bullet for a kid,” Bruno said. “If they think that they can march on a state capital and they can shut a school down and they can get attention to the needs of that school then, you know, I think they’re going to do it.”

Associated Press writer Michelle R. Smith in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.

	Students make tiny discoveries in Walnut Creek pollinator garden

The beginning of the school year brings a new crop of high school students who will be working with me at the Civic Park pollinator garden in Walnut Creek. I usually get a lot of questions about the garden throughout the school year, but to my delight the first week was full of enthusiasm and queries while finding tiny discoveries. I say tiny because the specimens I am writing about here are no larger than 1/2-inch.
While deadheading Black Sage (Salvia mellifera), the students and I discovered tiny clumps of mud along the stem. These “mud pots” are nests created by the potter wasp (Euodynerus species)—aptly named since they resemble clay pots.
When people think of wasps they usually think of the aggressive yellow jacket. Yellow jackets are considered social wasps because they live in groups or colonies. They build papery nests in the ground and during the summer the colony can grow to as many as 50,000. With the exception of the queen, the working brood lives for just one season. As summer wanes and food sources become scarce, they become more aggressive and interfere with our outdoor activities.


But there are many species of solitary wasps — those who build individual nests and lay one egg per nest. The potter wasp is a solitary that often goes unnoticed because of its small size. The black- and ivory-colored adults are not aggressive toward people. They are considered beneficial to the garden ecosystem because they pollinate plants as they feed on flower nectar. They also kill pests such as aphids, cabbage worms and tomato hornworms.
The female creates her nests in the spring and produces several generations of wasps each season. These pots, or brood cells, are packed with parasitized caterpillars that provide an immediate food source for her young as they emerge and develop. After packing the cells, she deposits a single egg and seals the nest.
The red drops on the leaf vein of the Valley oak (Quercus lobata)  are called galls. When the female Cynipid wasp (Andricus kingi) deposits her egg on the leaf, she also injects a chemical. The tree’s response is to create the gall, which keeps the wasp safe and with food until it reaches its adulthood and emerges from the gall.

According to Ron Russo, an expert on California galls, “There are over 150 species of galls associated with oak trees. Scientists suspect that these tiny wasps are able to manipulate genes in specific plant tissues, inducing the plant to create galls characteristic of their species. But the exact mechanism for this process remains a mystery”.As for eradicating galls, there is no need since they do not harm the tree and the wasps are an important food source for birds who rely on insects for 97 percent of their diet.
The little bump at the base of the Cottonwood (Populus fremontii) leaf is formed by a small green aphid. Like the oak gall, the little bump is the tree’s reaction to a chemical released by the aphid. It does not harm the tree, however if you want to control aphids, an application of horticultural oil can be applied on the tree when it is dormant. The oil kills the overwintering aphids in the bark fissures on the tree.

						A Redwood City police officer issues a ticket to a driver in Redwood City.		
	
By John Horgan | 
PUBLISHED: July 27, 2018 at 6:11 am | UPDATED: July 27, 2018 at 7:08 am


Taxpayers in San Mateo County owe the county’s civil grand jury a hearty thank-you for its latest report on the ever-increasing impact of public employee pensions on municipal budgets throughout the Peninsula.

According to the report issued last week, on average, nearly 14 percent of the general fund budgets of the county’s 20 cities goes toward financing pensions of current and retired workers. That represents about $1 of every $7 spent by those towns.

But it gets worse as we head into the future. The report notes that those pension responsibilities will double within seven years unless steps are taken to address this. In other words, $2 of every $7 spent will be allocated to pensions, crowding out spending on such basics as street repairs, parks, recreation programs, public safety, etc.

The grand jury’s analysis provides a detailed look at the budgets of several cities, including Redwood City, which is facing what has been termed an “unsustainable” fiscal future without fresh dollars or major program reductions (even in pension payouts) or a combination of the two to stabilize the situation.

This is occurring even as the community experiences a much-ballyhooed boom in economic (revenue-rich) development and recent healthy budget surpluses.

The report notes that, in the prior fiscal year, Redwood City spent 26 percent of its nonsafety employee payroll on pension costs. Without significant changes, that figure will rise to 42 percent within eight years, the document ominously predicts.

But that’s just for starters. The payroll share of public safety employee pension costs is expected to rise from 43 percent to 66 percent during that same period. Something has to give — and soon. No wonder there are worries aplenty in Redwood City.

Not surprisingly, Redwood City officials are looking to their taxpayers for relief.

In the past, the Grand Jury points out, cities have been less than up-front and clear about the lurking budgetary dangers of rising (and under-funded) pension requirements. And asking voters to approve a tax increase to bail out a pension funding problem is seen as a formula likely to induce failure at the ballot box.

					
				

Typically, the standard yes-vote line in such matters is to stress the need to preserve important city functions and services. The underlying issue of under-financed and mandated pensions is rarely, if ever, mentioned in any specific way and, if it is, it’s noted in passing.

Redwood City voters will be asked to boost their sales tax on the November ballot. Let’s see how straightforward the language on that ballot measure will be.

On Saturday from 4 to 8 p.m., again at the Courthouse Square, a Police Activities League fund-raiser, in Penna’s name, and a free music festival (which begins at noon) will be conducted. Admission to the fund-raiser is $25. For an invitation to that event, please call 650-455-5144.

Penna, the editor/publisher of Spectrum magazine and a tireless volunteer for the PAL and other organizations, passed away unexpectedly last month at the age of 59.

						A drug-smuggling tunnel was discovered near the U.S.-Mexico border underneath a former KFC restaurant in San Luis, Ariz., in August.		
	
By The Washington Post | 
PUBLISHED: August 24, 2018 at 6:03 pm | UPDATED: August 27, 2018 at 4:37 am


By Amy B Wang | Washington Post

The hole in the tile of the former Kentucky Fried Chicken was small: eight inches in diameter, barely large enough to fit a 15-piece family bucket. It could have easily been overlooked as just another deteriorating aspect of an abandoned fast-food restaurant, had authorities not known better.

After all, this wasn’t just any vacant KFC, but one in San Luis, Arizona, situated some 200 yards north of the U.S.-Mexico border. A person going through the old drive-through window might have caught glimpses of the 20-foot-tall border fence separating San Luis from Mexico in his rearview mirror.

Moreover, on Aug. 13, local police had arrested the building’s owner, Ivan Lopez, at a traffic stop where he was found with more than 325 pounds of illicit drugs. Records revealed Lopez had purchased the former KFC in April, paying $390,000 – all cash – for the abandoned restaurant. Soon, authorities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement obtained a search warrant and surrounded the building.

Once inside, they knew just where to look: Down at the ground. This was no fried chicken joint anymore.

Their suspicions were nearly confirmed with the discovery of the 8-inch opening, along a wall in the former restaurant’s rear kitchen area. Agents chipped away at its sides and, as the concrete gave way, the hole became a shaft. One person shimmied down and turned on a flashlight, scanning the surroundings. Hundreds of wooden two-by-four planks lined the walls, shoring up a veritable walkway that led due south.

It was an underground tunnel to Mexico.

The discovery, announced Wednesday, demanded inevitable comparisons to “Breaking Bad” and Los Pollos Hermanos. Countless news stories relayed the tunnel’s dimensions – 3 feet wide, 5 feet tall, about 600 feet long – as well as the mind-boggling amount of hard drugs that had been found on Lopez, more than $1 million worth of cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl and heroin.

					
				

But the tunnel affirmed another unspoken rule on America’s Southwest border: What can’t go up must go down. Or rather, what can’t go over the wall can and will go under it.

This was hardly the first tunnel, and it certainly wasn’t the most sophisticated one, to be discovered along the border, multiple officials said. It was simply the latest, in an ongoing game of drug-trafficking whack-a-mole that has literally moved underground.

“Unusual? Yes. But surprising? No,” said San Luis Police Chief Richard Jessup, when asked about the presence of these tunnels, a stone’s throw away from a bustling, official port of entry. “I mean, we’re the largest border city in Arizona with almost 38,000 people and growing very rapidly,”

Another tunnel had been found in the city in 2012, also close to the former KFC. Jessup pointed out there was already a border wall that spanned far beyond San Luis city limits, comprised of not just one, but two 20-foot-tall fences. One ran along the actual border and another ran parallel to the first, about 50 yards north. Border Patrol agents patrolled the dirt path in between the two fences.

“It’s very difficult in our area to get over that wall. You either are going to take a drone and fly it over or you tunnel underneath it,” Jessup said. “Of course, if you can’t go over the wall, you go under the wall.”

And so people have. There have been 203 tunnels discovered in the U.S. Border Patrol’s history, and this was the fifth one to be discovered in that region since 2007, said Border Patrol spokesman Jose Garibay III.

“Generally along the southwest border, every couple of months, we’re encountering a tunnel,” said Scott Brown, special agent in charge for ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations. “Tunnels are something we are constantly on the lookout for.”

Most are rudimentary, hand-dug tunnels that are unfinished, Brown said. In rare instances, however, agents will come upon a “sophisticated tunnel,” with everything from power lines to ventilation systems to concrete flooring. He believes the farthest a tunnel has made it across the U.S. border is about 2,000 feet.

Tunnels can be difficult to detect without sophisticated equipment or intelligence that keeps law enforcement officers one step ahead of the cartels who build them. But there are also some dead giveaways.

“One thing is a big pile of dirt,” Brown said, doing some quick mental math for the tunnel just discovered under the former KFC. “Again this is a 5-foot-by-3-foot-wide-by 590-feet-long hole in the ground. Rough estimate is that’s about 200 tons of dirt they had to get out and move surreptitiously.”

Other times an unwitting resident on either side of the border will report suspicious activity to law enforcement.

“We’ve had instances where people have come in and said, ‘Hey, I’m sitting in my house at night, and I hear this constant scratch-scratch-scratching, and I can’t figure out what it is,'” Brown said. “Well, again, you tell that to an HSI or Border Patrol agent, they’re going to guess somebody’s tunneling underneath your house or in close proximity to your house.”

While other tunnels might have been used for human smuggling, this one appeared to have been “limited” to the drug trade, owing to the tiny opening on the U.S. side, officials said. On the Mexico side, the tunnel’s entrance was hidden beneath a trapdoor under a bed in a residential home.

More alarming than the existence of the tunnel was what passed through it, Brown said.
“Generally with tunnels what we’ve seen is marijuana,” he said. “This was a purely hard narcotics tunnel. Everything that we seized was hard narcotics. So I think that’s what makes this tunnel a little unique and frankly a little more scary than some of the other ones we’ve seen.”

By Kevin Kelly | kkelly@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
December 28, 2017 at 3:26 pm


The Belle Haven branch of the Menlo Park Library is set to reopen Jan. 9 with expanded hours after getting a facelift.

The library will show off a new coat of paint, new carpeting and new furniture, as well as new exterior signs. There will be additions to the adult, teen and Spanish language collections, as well as new STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) events, beginning with a Winter Science Workshop on Jan. 27 for first- through fifth-graders. The City Council in October appropriated $140,000 toward the facility and collection improvements.

“We also have an open house for the branch scheduled for the 27th of January,” Assistant Library Services Director Nick Szegda said in an email. “Not a lot of details yet, but we will push them out as soon as they are available.”

The library, which sits adjacent to Belle Haven Elementary School on Ivy Drive, has over the past 15 months reduced the number of hours it’s open to the community by serving only students during school hours.

After catching criticism for reducing the branch’s hours while planning to rebuild the downtown library, the city earlier this year approved a new part-time librarian for the branch.

As a result, the branch should remain open to the public an additional 13 hours a week. The new hours, starting Jan. 9, are 3:15 to 9 p.m. Monday through Wednesday; 3:15 to 6 p.m. Thursday; 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday; and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.

The Belle Haven library renovations took place around the same time that the city is doing a $100,000 study on the feasibility of building a new Belle Haven library at a separate location. The neighborhood wants a library of roughly 14,000 square feet built at the Onetta Harris Community Center campus on Terminal Avenue. The city is also establishing a seven-member advisory committee to assist with the study.

Some Belle Haven residents resent that the downtown library rebuild could cost as much as $45 million — with roughly half of the expense being paid for by local philanthropist John Arrillaga — while just a fraction of that amount has been dedicated to the Belle Haven branch.

“We’ve developed four different plans on how a library could be built in Belle Haven,” Matt Henry told the council in October. “We did not just start thinking about this library four months ago. We’ve been working on this for a decade and we’re still waiting.”

By Associated Press | 
PUBLISHED: September 1, 2018 at 8:04 am | UPDATED: September 1, 2018 at 3:03 pm


By JOSH REPLOGLE | The Associated Press

DETROIT  — The bishop who officiated Aretha Franklin’s funeral apologized Friday to Ariana Grande for how he touched her onstage and a joke he made about her name.

Bishop Charles H. Ellis III led Franklin’s funeral and awkwardly greeted Grande on stage after she performed “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” Images of the moment showed Ellis’ hand holding Grande well above her waist, with his fingers pressing against one side of her chest.



The preacher apologized in an interview with The Associated Press at the cemetery where Franklin was interred late Friday.

“It would never be my intention to touch any woman’s breast. … I don’t know I guess I put my arm around her,” Ellis said. “Maybe I crossed the border, maybe I was too friendly or familiar but again, I apologize.”

He said he hugged all the performers during Friday’s eight-hour service.

“I hug all the female artists and the male artists,” Ellis said. “Everybody that was up, I shook their hands and hugged them. That’s what we are all about in the church. We are all about love.”

He added: “The last thing I want to do is to be a distraction to this day. This is all about Aretha Franklin.”

					
				

Many people posted close-up images of the moment on Twitter, tagging it #RespectAriana.

Ellis also apologized to Grande, her fans and Hispanic community for making a joke about seeing her name on the program and thinking it was a new item on the Taco Bell menu.

“I personally and sincerely apologize to Ariana and to her fans and to the whole Hispanic community,” Ellis said. “When you’re doing a program for nine hours you try to keep it lively, you try to insert some jokes here and there.”
Ellis’ touching of Grande overshadowed some criticism earlier in the ceremony the short dress Grande wore for her performance. Numerous people posted criticisms online that the dress was too short for church.

Grande’s representative did not return an email message seeking comment Friday.


The fact that a woman was disrespected multiple times on live television by men who are in positions of power blows my mind. Just imagine what happens behind closed doors. This was totally inappropriate, a short dress is NOT an invitation. #RespectAriana pic.twitter.com/YkJmmEpgL9

			After quarter century of rapid expansion, charter school growth slowing in California

By Louis Freedberg and John Fensterwald, EdSource | California Watch
PUBLISHED: August 19, 2018 at 6:00 am | UPDATED: August 19, 2018 at 6:23 am


After a quarter century of steady expansion, the rate of growth for charter schools in California has slowed to a crawl over the past five years.

During the just-completed school year, the number of charter schools grew by a mere 1.6 percent — from 1,254 schools in 2016-17 to 1,275 in 2017-18. That was even lower than last year’s 1.9 percent growth, which set a record for the lowest rate of growth in at least two decades.

These sluggish rates of growth, mirrored by similar slowdown nationally, present a sharp contrast to the double-digit rates of expansion of charter schools for most years since California approved its charter law in 1992.

Far outpacing every other state, California charter schools now enroll over 630,000 students or 1 in 10 of the state’s public school students. The slowdown in their growth could increase competition among parents and students to get into the most sought-after charter schools and in general limit the choices that they have beyond traditional public schools. It is also stirring concerns among charter school advocates that the slowdown may represent a permanent feature of the California education landscape, not just a temporary pause.

The slowdown is accelerating at precisely the time President Donald Trump and his Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos are trying to expand education options for parents and children, which includes more charter schools, as well as tax-payer subsidies for private school tuition.

What is happening in California is being watched closely by national charter school advocates. “California is a place where you see charter schools in a wide variety of urban communities as well as in rural areas,” said Todd Ziebarth, senior vice president of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. “We don’t see that in every state.” A slowdown in California, he said, will have “a big impact on the national numbers (of charter schools), and given its size and diversity it is the place to look for lessons for why it is happening and how to jumpstart growth in California and across the country.”

Contributing to the slowdown are a range of impediments. Charter advocates say a principal reason is a wariness among financially troubled school districts to authorize new charters because of their potential impact on district budgets. Another is the difficulty charter schools have finding and paying for new facilities to house them, despite the requirements of Prop. 39, a voter-approved initiative requiring districts to offer them space. The independent Legislative Analyst’s Office recently called for a “comprehensive review” of California’s approach to underwriting the costs of facilities, which it suggested was neither “coherent” nor “rational.”

Also, from a national perspective, the pipeline of potential founding organizations, education leaders and teachers “just doesn’t seem to be as robust as it was five years ago,” said Ziebarth.

Edgar Zazueta, senior director of government relations for the Association of California School Administrators, also said that districts are not intentionally “looking for loopholes to make it difficult to open charter schools.” He doubted that it is a major factor in slowing charter growth in the state. But he also said that “it is probably time to look at Prop. 39 to see if it is meeting the spirit of the law for both charter schools and traditional public schools.”

					
				

Until now, charter schools in California have benefited from the unqualified support from every governor since Gov. Pete Wilson. None has been a more ardent supporter than Gov. Jerry Brown, who founded two Oakland charter schools when he was mayor of Oakland. As governor, he has repeatedly vetoed bills that might have crimped charter school expansion in the state. But that could change should Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom be elected governor in November, as is highly likely.

Newsom won the June primary after vanquishing Antonio Villaraigosa, his leading Democratic opponent, despite opposition spending by wealthy charter school backers who poured $23 million into an independent expenditure committee supporting the former Los Angeles mayor.

Newsom, who has been endorsed by the California Teachers Association, insists that he is a supporter of high quality, innovative charter schools. But right after his primary victory, he said that if elected he intends to sign legislation requiring charter schools to be more transparent with their finances and operations and to adhere to stricter conflict of interest rules on their governing boards. Ziebarth said that were Newsom to sign such legislation, which has been strongly promoted by teachers unions, “the slowdown we are seeing in California could be accelerated, or growth could actually come to a halt.”

New restrictions like these might make people more reluctant to open charter schools if they knew the state will be exercising more possibly burdensome oversight. It could also make potential board members, especially potential financial backers, think twice about serving on charter boards. In one veto message in 2016, Brown said that such legislation could discourage “committed individuals” from being on charter boards and would go “too far in prescribing how these boards operate.”

Charter school leaders also point to long waiting lists at many schools and say that the demand from parents to get their children into charter schools is still robust. They note that student enrollments in charter schools continue to grow at a faster rate than the total number of schools.

That’s because some existing charter schools have been able to expand their enrollments by adding grades and students as permitted by their charter authorizations.

But there may be limits to how much enrollment growth they can handle this way. During the just-completed school year, student enrollments in charter schools increased by 4.6 percent — or about 27,000 students — over the preceding year, at a time when the overall school enrollment in California is not increasing. In 2016-17, charter school enrollments grew by 3.6 percent. These represent the lowest enrollment growth years in California in nearly two decades. Before 2012, it was a routine occurrence for enrollments to grow by double digits from one year to the next.

A key reason for the slowdown, some charter school leaders argue, are the difficulties they are having getting districts to follow the terms of Proposition 39, an initiative approved by voters in 2000. It requires districts to provide space to charter schools that enroll a minimum of 80 students living within the geographic boundaries of those districts. The space offered must be “reasonably equivalent” to other district facilities.

“School districts have a built-in motivation or incentive to make opening of a new charter as difficult as possible,” said Jed Wallace, president of the California Charter Schools Association in an interview earlier this year. He said when charter schools apply for space under the provisions of Prop. 39, often districts look for technical or bureaucratic reasons to deny their request.

One tactic, he said, is for districts to question the validity of signatures on “intent to enroll” forms submitted by parents as part of a petition to open a charter school. If districts question enough of them so that fewer than 80 students are projected to enroll, districts do not have to provide the space requested.

School districts sometimes offer one-year leases, as opposed to multi-year leases, said Eric Premack, director of the Charter Schools Development Center that provides charter schools with technical support. Short-term leases make long-range planning — and recruiting of both students and staff — more difficult, he said.

If a district denies a petition for a new charter, the applicant can appeal to its county board of education and if rejected there, then to the State Board of Education. An indication of the growing obstacles charter schools are facing is that the number of appeals reaching the state board has nearly tripled in recent years.

In the last four years, the board heard 30 appeals through July. That compares with the 11 appeals it heard between 2011 and 2014

Also contributing to the reluctance of some districts to approve new charters is declining enrollment in many districts. That means they receive less in state funds based on student in attendance, so the loss of funds due to students leaving for charter schools is felt more acutely.

All of this, said the charter schools association’s Wallace, “has put districts under a level of fiscal stress that makes them more urgently resist charter school growth and is leading them to take steps that they have not previously taken.”

Rising costs of employee pensions and of special education have compounded districts’ financial pressures. By law, school boards are not supposed to consider the potential financial impact on a district as a factor in evaluating a charter application. But some appear to do so without giving that as the official reason for denying a charter.

Troy Flint, senior communications director for the California School Boards Association, said that he hasn’t seen districts using the “letter of the (Prop. 39) law in a malicious way,” but that more clarity about how to respond to Prop. 39 requests for charter school space is needed.

“I’m not sure anyone anticipated that charter schools would flourish to this extent,” he said. California’s original 1992 charter law limited the number of charter schools statewide to 100, with no more than 10 in any district, except for L.A. Unified, which was permitted to have 20. The law was subsequently changed by the Legislature to allow for far more schools.

“The infrastructure needed to manage this growth, and the interplay between districts and charters has not nearly kept pace with the demand,” Flint said.

Charter schools and districts should be working with the state to tackle the problem, he said. “Right now, the system is overburdened,” he said.

Just how the current slowdown will play out in future years is impossible to predict. Some of the state’s most prominent charter school backers, such as Netflix CEO and multi-billionaire Reed Hastings, would like to see a majority of children enrolled in charter schools, a process that would require steady growth over decades to occur.

But the California School Boards Association’s Zazueta thinks that the years of rapid expansion in schools and enrollments may be over. “We may have reached a peak in the very substantial growth we have seen,” he said.

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

OAKLAND — There were highlights galore Tuesday night — thunderous dunks, explosive blocks, electrifying steals — and that was just in the first quarter.

In a tense, tight Northern California Open Division boys basketball semifinal, it took everything Bishop O’Dowd had to get past Modesto Christian.

But the Dragons finally did it, winning 61-58 before a charged-up, standing-room-only crowd at Laney College.

The outcome was not decided until Junior Ballard’s 3-point attempt from half court caromed off the rim and landed out of bounds with a second left.

“We played great together and that’s all that matters,” said O’Dowd’s Washington-bound guard Elijah Hardy, who scored 15 of his 21 points in the second half despite not feeling well before the game. “We got the win, and we’re on to the next one. We’re not done yet.”

The second-seeded Dragons advance to play fourth-seeded Sheldon-Sacramento on Saturday night at Santa Clara University for the NorCal championship and a trip to Sacramento a week later for the state final.

O’Dowd (27-5) led by two points at halftime and by the same margin through three quarters.

Before the final period began, longtime coach Lou Richie told his players what they needed to do to lead at the end.

					
				

“We had to rebound,” Richie said. “The fourth quarter we said, ‘We’re not keeping score. We’re keeping rebounds as the score. If we get 10 rebounds in the fourth quarter, we can win this game.'”

The Dragons followed Richie’s instructions, taking care of the boards and not giving third-seeded Modesto Christian (29-4) second and third opportunities to keep possessions alive.

But O’Dowd made the final seconds more tense than necessary, missing all four of its free-throw attempts in the fourth quarter. That included two front end of one-and-ones, the latter with nine seconds left that would have iced the game.

“Everybody said great game,” Richie said. “It was too great a game.”

Modesto Christian, a team loaded with talent and height, stormed to a 10-2 lead in the opening minutes. But by the end of the first quarter, it was quite clear that this game was not going to be easy for either side.

To counter Modesto Christian’s size advantage, Richie called on 6-foot-8 junior Raymond Hawkins, who made his first appearance with 30 seconds left in the opening period.

Before the second quarter started, the big fella had the crowd roaring as he threw down a dunk on a breakaway to pull O’Dowd to within 18-14.

“He had a great game for us tonight,” Richie said. “He was a presence and he had really good energy. I am happy for him.”

Hawkins said he was just trying to contribute after missing much of the season.

“The whole day at school the whole team was focused,” he said. “It was a long, long year for me especially. I was eager to get back on the court. I am happy I am back with my team. We worked hard together.”

Hawkins, having overcome what Richie has called “personal challenges,” is just one of the story lines on this O’Dowd team.

Another is the seniors, the guys who are trying to end their careers with bookend state championships.

Gaskin had 11 points and was quite active near the basket, blocking shots and grabbing rebounds.

Guard Ross Williams was steady and lightning quick with the ball in his hands and had two momentum-swinging deep 3-pointers in the second quarter.

Then there was Hardy, who hit two 3-pointers in the second half but also sliced through tight gaps to the basket, scoring layups with his right and left hand.

“Elijah came into the game not feeling well and for him to hold it together for us, that’s a real team player,” Williams said. “He is the heart and soul of this team. We follow him.”

The Dragons also got 12 points from junior Brenden Patrick.

And some hard-nosed defense and rebounding.

“Tonight we had to come out with a lot of grit and grind,” Williams said. “We came out here with a mindset that we were going to have to win the game on defense. That’s what we did.”

						Freedom’s Giles Jackson, shown here in a file photo, scored three touchdowns in 37-24 victory at San Ramon Valley on Friday, Sept. 14, 2018.

PUBLISHED: September 15, 2018 at 12:19 am | UPDATED: September 15, 2018 at 2:34 pm


DANVILLE — Freedom struggled early to establish any rhythm on offense against San Ramon Valley on the road Friday night.

The turning point of a 37-24 victory came on the last play of the first half — an 82-yard hook and ladder that saw Michigan commit Giles Jackson sprint down his own sideline in electric fashion.

“That play was crazy,” Jackson said. “At first I didn’t think it was going to work. I was saying in my head, ‘What if this actually works?’ ”

The 5-foot-8, 185-pound senior found the end zone three times for the Falcons (4-1), who trailed 17-16 going into the locker room but had snatched momentum away from SRV (2-2).

“Once we came into halftime, we came together as a family and came out and did our thing,” said Freedom senior Daniel Roanhorse, who came down with three interceptions.

The Wolves led 10-0 after an 80-yard punt return to the house by Clay Facteau in the first quarter and a 41-yard field goal by Jayden Benedict to cap a 14-play drive with 10:12 left in the half.

Freedom quarterback Joey Aguilar put his team on the board after the ensuring drive with a 16-yard touchdown on fourth down to Jackson, who juked past defenders to cross the goal line.

“The show he put on was amazing, that’s why Michigan is getting one of the best backs in the whole country,” Freedom coach Andrew Cotter said. “And they should be real excited because I’m excited to be able to coach him now. Just hopefully they get to use him in a lot of different ways that we use him.”



A four-star recruit, Jackson announced his commitment to Michigan on Monday — and he couldn’t be happier.

					
				

“I don’t have all the pressure of coaches talking to me,” he said. “And some schools I know I don’t like, but I don’t want to be mean, so I had to tell them I wasn’t going to their school and thank you for recruiting me. And now that that’s out of the way I can just finally concentrate on the season.”

Midway through the second quarter, Freedom junior Taijon Collins blocked a punt that bounced out of the end zone for a safety to get within 10-9.

SRV briefly reestablished momentum as it forced a pair of turnovers on the next two possessions, a fumble recovery by Facteau and an interception by Cole Mortensen. One play after the pick forced by the pass rush of Harrison Wheeler, the Wolves struck for a 29-yard touchdown to a streaking Facteau from quarterback Brandon Cammisa.

Suddenly, it was 17-9 in favor of SRV with 11.1 seconds left in the half.

Instead of kneeling to gather itself at halftime, Freedom went for broke with the hook and ladder.

“I’ve called that play a bunch of times and the kids, some of them execute it, some of them don’t — and they got it done,” Cotter said. “The kids did a great job.”

Aguilar hit wideout Jaimier Parker on a button hook, and as defenders collapsed to tackle him, Jackson ran underneath to catch a quick flick of the ball.

“They got a good play and they got us on it — not much I can say other than that,” SRV coach Aaron Becker said. “I mean, we followed the kid, he lateralled it and there was nobody home.”

Freedom didn’t look back.

Aguilar, who finished 23 of 33 for 338 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions, led scoring drives on three of the first four possessions in the second half — TD throws of 6 and 10 yards to Parker and Mekel Ealy, respectively, followed by a 1-yard plunge from Jackson.

“They tested his mettle and he stood up to every challenge they gave him,” Cotter said of the 6-3, 175-pound senior. “That’s what a quarterback does, leader of this team, does a great and just real proud of him and his poise that he showed tonight.”

Unable to establish the run — Stanford commit Tristan Sinclair was held to 42 yards on 11 carries — it didn’t help that the Wolves turned it over three times in the second half, with interceptions on back-to-back drives by Roanhorse sealing the win.

“I thought the kids played tough all night,” Becker said. “We just didn’t make some of the key plays when we had our opportunities and they did.”

Next up for Freedom is a trip to Antioch (4-0) as play opens in the rugged Bay Valley Athletic League.

For now, the Falcons will enjoy this victory.

“Everyone doubted us and we came out here, played our game and came out with the win,” Roanhorse said.

“Hat’s off to the boys, they battled through some adversity,” Cotter said. “It shows a lot about the young men that they are.”

Meanwhile, it’s back to the drawing board for the Wolves with hopes to learn from a tough loss.

“You hope that’s the way it plays out,” Becker said. “Go back and look at the film, make your corrections and hopefully we got better tonight.”

					By far the most comforting dish on Kronnerburger's menu was the epic Patty
Melt. Now you can make it at home using the recipe in Chris Kronner's first
cookbook, "A Burger to Believe In." (Photo: Eric Wolfinger)
				

Early fall is all about those highly-anticipated hot new cookbooks, including one from Chris Kronner, owner of Oakland’s beloved Kronnerburger and author of the tomb of its secrets, “A Burger to Believe In” (Ten Speed Press, 239 pages, $30). If you frequented the Piedmont Avenue burger joint, you remember this patty melt with onions cooked in beef tallow, sharp cheddar, a touch of bechamel and Chinese hot mustard to balance out the richness. Kronner typically favors simplicity in his burger building but this heavy piece of heaven is complex and memorably delicious.
Kronnerburger’s Ultimate Patty Melt
Serves 4
Caramelized onions:


5 tablespoons rendered beef tallow or unsalted butter
1 white onion, thinly sliced
Kosher salt
Patty melt:
1 pound freshly ground, dry-aged, grass-fed beef
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, divided use
8 slices levain bread
¼ cup Chinese hot mustard
¾ cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
¼ cup béchamel (see below)
Bechamel:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
¾ cup milk
¼ cup heavy cream
1 bay leaf
Dash of red wine vinegar
1 pinch each kosher salt, black pepper, ground nutmeg

Directions:
	For the onions, melt the tallow or butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onions, turn the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Season with salt. Set aside until ready to serve.
	For the patty melt: Heat the broiler. Divide the beef into four 4-ounce balls, handling minimally. Put a sheet of plastic wrap over a 4-inch ring mold on a cutting board or other hard surface. Put a ball in the middle of the mold and gently press down with the palm of your hand, forming a patty that is 4 inches wide. Pop it out with the plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to cook.
	Make the bechamel: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking continuously, until golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Whisk in the milk and cream and add the bay leaf. Keep whisking and cook until the béchamel boils and starts to thicken, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vinegar, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Remove the bay leaf. Pour into a bowl to cool. Can be stored, covered and refrigerated, up to 3 days.
	Using 4 tablespoons of the butter, butter one side of each levain slice and place, buttered side down, on a baking sheet. Spread the mustard on the unbuttered sides of four slices and top the other four slices with cheese. Broil until the cheese melts and begins to get a touch of color, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the broiler.
	While the bread toasts, cook the patties. Heat a skillet over high heat. Salt both sides of each patty with 1⁄4 teaspoon salt and place them in the hot skillet. Cook until deeply browned on one side, about 2 minutes, then flip the patties and cook to a nice medium-rare.
	Place a patty on a cheese-topped bread slice and top with caramelized onions. Spread 1 tablespoon of béchamel on a mustard-topped bread slice and cap the sandwich. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.
	Heat the remaining tablespoon butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sandwiches, one or two at a time and retoast the sandwiches until crisp, about 90 seconds per side. Slice each sandwich in half and serve immediately.

	Swastika scrawled on Fremont council candidate’s sign

FREMONT — Police are investigating after a swastika was scrawled onto a Fremont City Council candidate’s campaign sign.
Justin Sha Justin Sha, who is running for the District 4 seat, said the vandalism was discovered Wednesday. Other signs he had placed at Mission Boulevard and Ondina Drive were also defaced.
“I was actually at the Oakland City Attorney’s Office when my father texted me the photos, and it really is something else to see a Nazi swastika etched onto a picture of your forehead,” Sha said.


Fremont police opened an investigation after spokeswoman Geneva Bosques learned of the vandalism through a Facebook post and brought it to the attention of Chief Kimberly Petersen. An officer has canvassed the area for surveillance footage that might reveal the culprit.

“We are investigating this as a possible hate crime,” Bosques said. “This is definitely cause for concern. Fremont is a very welcoming community and we celebrate diversity.”
Sha said he was “very shocked” to see a swastika scrawled onto one of his signs given the city’s reputation.
“Fremont is over 50 percent immigrant, so it is deeply troubling that it is happening here,” he said. “In many ways, we are supposed to be a model for other parts of America.”
Sha also had a message for the culprit.
“My message would be to ask yourself whether you would like what was done to me done to you or your own family members. You clearly want someone else to win, and that’s fine,” he said.
“But do you have to use a universally abhorred symbol of hate to get your message across? If you disagree with my ideas, then let’s discuss so we can come up with better ones. But don’t weaponize the pain and suffering of others to do it.”
Anyone with information about the vandalism is asked to contact the Fremont Police Department at 510-790-6800, Ext. 3.

By Emily Luong | Mosaic Staff Writer
PUBLISHED: July 8, 2016 at 10:00 am | UPDATED: May 24, 2017 at 1:25 pm


Bud Harrington, a retired English teacher from the East Side Union High School District, was known for unique classroom activities such as ghost storytelling in a darkened theater, analyzing songs from his Simon & Garfunkel playlist and putting together a personal magazine. 

While other teachers focused on getting their students to meet standards, Harrington said he made an effort to enhance students’ creativity, cultural appreciation and enthusiasm for learning. His classroom relied on a relaxed, bean bag-filled atmosphere with “assignments that allowed for low-achieving, high-risk students to enjoy learning and to stay in school,” he said. 

“School should never be about making mindless working robots out of human beings,” Harrington said. “While students need the technology and the ability to adapt, they should never be deprived of learning sweeping lines from Shakespeare or admiring the subtle colors that Michelangelo used when painting the Sistine Chapel.” 

California schools have slowly been implementing Common Core standards, which are meant to ensure that students are ready for life beyond high school. The standards focus on collaboration and the development of verbal communication skills to prepare students for college and career. 

But while most educators have embraced the standards, Harrington does not believe these standards are beneficial to students. He is in the minority among teachers and administrators recently surveyed by WestEd, a nonprofit organization working with education. 

The study, conducted earlier in the year, reported that “56 to 92 percent of teachers and administrators believe that the new standards are more rigorous than previous standards, that the standards make learning more relevant to students’ everyday lives, and that the standards will positively impact the degree to which students are prepared for college and careers.” 

Bernadette Marcias, a sixth-grade teacher at San Jose’s Carolyn Clark Elementary School, numbers among the majority of teachers who support the shifts in language arts, explaining that “it comes down to making sure your students have the skills to be in the real world. I want to make sure when a student leaves my classroom, they can express their ideas without being afraid, that they can be a leader.” 

However, she acknowledged potential drawbacks to the focus on collaboration and discussion that comes with the new standards. 

“Students without the vocabulary and verbal and writing skills can be seen as not being a team player because they don’t have the basics and cannot participate in higher-level discussion groups,” Marcias said. 

					
				

Concern for students who struggle with the basics of reading and writing is common among teachers and administrators. In order to support them while still maintaining the rigor of the standards to which students are held, teachers must implement differentiated instruction, teaching to meet each student’s needs. 

“Teachers have to know their kids, know what they need, and also never make kids feel like they’re less than someone else,” said Marilyn Goldsmith, who has taught for 31 years at San Jose’s Millbrook Elementary School. This kind of differentiated instruction is time-intensive and requires professional development for teachers, the WestEd study reported. 

Administrators recognize the need for professional development but remain positive, in line with the findings of WestEd studies. 

“Common Core language arts has always been a work in progress, but parent criticism was less than that of math, because the shifts for language arts weren’t as big,” said Leila Welch, principal of Matsumoto Elementary School in South San Jose. 

According to Denise Williams, director of categorical programs for the city’s Evergreen Elementary School District, students have responded favorably to shifts in the teaching of language arts, “enjoying their learning because it is so nontraditional.” 

In high schools, however, negative responses have been more emphatic. 

“Common sense works for me. Common Core doesn’t,” Harrington said. 

“Now, we are seeing a trend that sits on the precipice of replacing great works for unknown, or worse, banal writing,” he said. As an English teacher, this was one of his major concerns regarding the new curriculum, which focuses on expository, technical writing as opposed to literature. 

Some teachers are concerned not only about what they describe as mediocre reading material, but also its effects on students. Some worry that by focusing only on structure, students will miss out on developing a more nuanced use of language. 

Nicole Devincenzi teaches English 1 and AP Literature at Evergreen Valley High School, which are the lowest and highest levels, respectively, of English taught in high schools. She has seen both simplistic and grandiose writing. In her opinion, “Common Core is more focused on structure, rather than style. Setting standards simply based on correct structure and development of ideas puts students at a C-level performance. 

“If kids grow up analyzing literature indepth since elementary school, it raises the standard for the AP level. I want my AP students not to meet the standards, but to beat the standards,” Devincenzi said. However, she also worries that “holding elementary-school students at too-high of standards for speaking, writing, and reading will contribute to a loss of enthusiasm for literature” that may affect students’ interest in taking AP English courses in high school. 

Teachers from both ends of the K-12 schooling system concurred, professing similar concerns. 

Goldsmith, the veteran Millbrook Elementary teacher, summarized many teachers’ sentiments. “I hope the kids still love learning,” she said. “There should be joy, and there needs to be balance. Constantly explaining what you’re thinking really challenges your brain, so as a teacher I want them to grow as learners, but I also want them to have a lifelong love of learning.”

			Will rats be more likely to kill young doves if I stop feeding them?		

	
	

Woman feeding doves has inadvertently attracted rats to her backyard, and worries that rats might become more aggressive.

						Doves are shy, quiet creatures that spend a good deal of time on the ground, feeding. That can make them vulnerable to a number of predators.		
	
By Joan Morris | jmorris@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: September 25, 2018 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: September 25, 2018 at 7:01 am


DEAR JOAN:  I have doves nesting on my patio and the babies soon will fly down to the ground for a week or so, I guess. I’ve been putting out birdseed and have apparently been nurturing a family or two of rats. Suddenly both adult and baby rats are coming out to eat the seeds, and not just at night.

I don’t want to kill the rats, but I don’t want the baby doves to be their dinner. I was going to stop putting out the birdseed to see if the rats will leave, but I also think I should keep providing the rats with food so they won’t eat the baby birds. I know you said they rarely do, but wonder if it makes sense to not deprive them right when there are babies on the ground.

Once the babies are gone, I will have someone come and remove any piles of rock that the rats are living and nesting in.

Is it likely that once I stop putting out the birdseed the rats will move on? I have a lot of trees, however, and I’m afraid they will stay. I won’t use poison, so wondering if you have any other suggestions for inviting them to leave my yard.

I’ve been obsessed with birds being killed in my yard recently, either by hawks or neighbors’ cats, and just don’t want any more death.

Ellie Kahn, Bay Area

DEAR ELLIE: Your baby doves should be just fine sharing the seed with the rats, and it makes sense to continue to feed them — and by default the rats — until they fledged.

All creatures need three basic things for survival — food, water and shelter. By removing the seed, you’ll be eliminating at least one source of food. Having someone clean up your yard, remove nesting spots and close up areas in your house where the rats can get in will take away shelter.

With that encouragement, the rats should relocate, but it could take some time. Don’t put out more seed until you’re certain they’re gone.

					
				



DEAR JOAN: A large portion of my gardening includes plants in large pots. What do I do with used potting soil?

I have a large pile of used potting soil in a bin. Simply tossing it in the garbage and buying new soil seems wasteful for several reasons, not the least of which is money. Can I reuse it? If so, how do I go about that? Do I need to add fertilizer or other amendments?

Jerry Epps, Milpitas

DEAR JERRY: You can most certainly reuse potting soil, with a couple of provisions.

Potting soil isn’t really soil. It’s a mixture of bark, plant material and fillers. When you grow in it, the plants take up all the nutrients they can find, which eventually can deplete the potting soil, making it not very good at supporting plant life.

You’ll need to add in fertilizer and compost to refresh it, or you might want to buy half as much potting soil as you need and blend it with the older stuff.

Even though it is not technically soil, it can still contain some soil-borne pathogens, so if you used it to grow tomatoes, you don’t want to reuse it to grow tomatoes again. Crop rotation rules still apply.
If you used insecticides, pesticides or herbicides in the soil, you might not want to reuse it. You also can compost it, which will definitely restore its vigor.

						In this Sept. 4, 2018 photo, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, listens to Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. speak during a Senate Judiciary Committee nominations hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. FBI agents interviewed one of the three women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct as Republicans and Democrats quarreled over whether the bureau would have enough time and freedom to conduct a thorough investigation before a high-stakes vote on his nomination to the nation’s highest court.

WASHINGTON — FBI leaders are warily trying to navigate their way through the politically charged background-check investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as the bureau seeks to protect itself now — and after the midterm elections — from what could be fierce congressional criticism, according to people familiar with the matter.

The White House has given the FBI until Friday to provide the results of a week-long inquiry into allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted female students while in high school and college — accusations he has angrily denied. Officials said the FBI could finish before Friday, particularly as senators clamor for information ahead of an expected first procedural vote on his confirmation this week.

FBI agents have completed a first batch of interviews of four individuals closest to the alleged events, and the White House has given the bureau a green light to conduct some further interviews, according to the people familiar with the matter.

On Tuesday, the FBI moved beyond those initial four people, interviewing Tim Gaudette, a Georgetown Prep classmate of Kavanaugh’s. Gaudette’s lawyer, Kenneith Eichner, said an FBI interview took place but declined to comment further. Gaudette’s home was the site of a July 1, 1982, party that Kavanaugh references on his calendar and has become the focus of lawmakers’ concerns.



FBI agents have also interviewed Mark Judge, a key Kavanaugh high school friend who has denied any knowledge of a teenage gathering like the one described by Kavanaugh’s first accuser.

In the interview, Judge also denied recent allegations leveled by Julie Swetnick, saying he had no knowledge of anything like what she had claimed — that he, Kavanaugh or other male friends tried at house parties to get girls drunk in order to take advantage of them, according to two people familiar with the interview.

Another friend from Kavanaugh’s high school days, Chris Garrett, has also completed an FBI interview, according to Garrett’s lawyer, William Sullivan, Jr., who declined to comment further.

Discussions between the FBI and the White House are complicated by a number of factors — the president’s long-running distrust of the agency over its Russia probe, the intense criticism by members of Congress of the FBI’s handling of politically sensitive investigations, and the added difficulty of conducting an inquiry that could tip the scales in deciding who becomes the next member of the Supreme Court.

					
				

One political consideration looms larger than those issues, according to people familiar with FBI and administration deliberations: If the Democrats win control of the House, lawmakers could launch investigations into exactly what White House and bureau officials said internally about the Kavanaugh matter.

The White House and FBI “are being very careful with each other,” said one person familiar with the matter, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations. “Everyone realizes that they are under a huge amount of scrutiny, and will be when it’s over, too.”

Several people involved in the discussions said part of the challenge is in handling the Kavanaugh inquiry like a “regular” background check when the circumstances make it highly unusual.

In many background checks, interviews will be conducted by a single agent, but the Kavanaugh matter is anything but a standard inquiry.

When the FBI met one of Kavanaugh’s accusers, Deborah Ramirez, in Boulder, Colorado, this past weekend, they sent two agents, and a supervisory agent waited in an adjoining room, according to people familiar with the matter.

John Clune, an attorney for Ramirez, said Tuesday on Twitter that his client spoke with the FBI for more than two hours Sunday in a “detailed and productive interview.” The agents “were clearly motivated to investigate the matter in any way they were permitted,” he added. But he asserted that Ramirez had provided the names and contact information of more than 20 witnesses who might be able to corroborate her allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when they were at Yale, and that, as far as Clune knew, the FBI had not contacted any of them as of Tuesday.

“Though we appreciated the agents who responded on Sunday, we have great concern that the FBI is not conducting — or not being permitted to conduct — a serious investigation,” he said.

Attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who said she was assaulted by Kavanaugh when they were teens and who testified to the Senate last week, wrote FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday to say they were concerned the FBI had not sought an interview with her.

“It is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr. Ford’s allegations without interviewing her, Judge Kavanaugh, or the witnesses we have identified in our letters to you,” the lawyers wrote, demanding an immediate answer to what they said were days of silence from the FBI.

The bureau declined to comment.

The Kavanaugh investigation is being led by the FBI’s Security Division, a component of the Human Resources Branch that is normally tasked with handling background checks.

Because the White House and even the president are dictating what the bureau should do, Wray is also involved in the matter, according to people familiar with the work.

Background checks are a mainstay of the FBI, but they tend not to be exciting — or visible — cases. They are often assignments given to younger agents to learn how to handle paperwork and conduct interviews.

The Kavanaugh investigation is playing out publicly — with lawyers for those who are interviewed often confirming that their clients have been talked to.

Some people have approached the bureau on their own, and at times been frustrated to be routed to a tip line or online reporting form. That is how the bureau normally handles voluminous tips in high-profile matters, but in a probe with a short deadline, the response feels inadequate to some.

Law enforcement officials said they expect to be attacked by whichever side dislikes the findings — or by both sides.

Since Trump ordered the background investigation reopened, the FBI has assiduously declined to comment, referring all questions about its work to the White House. Because the matter is a background check, rather than a criminal investigation, it is not inappropriate for the White House to call the shots.

“The bureau isn’t going to make any conclusions, just gather the facts they can substantiate and write the reports and hand in their work,” said Joe Lewis, a former senior FBI official who at one point in his career oversaw background-check investigations. “They’re not going to play footsie with it or shade anything.”

Joseph Campbell, a former FBI assistant director of the Criminal Investigative Division, said the bureau will probably do what it always does in political controversy: fall back on process.

“It is quite a situation,” Campbell said. “They’re going to continue to march on following that normal procedure, despite a lot of the other noise going on around them.”

That is not to say there won’t be challenges. Campbell said that in his experience with background checks or other investigations at the FBI, “I never encountered an instance where I was directed in regard to specifically talk to these people or don’t talk to these people.”
The bureau, too, cannot solve the political question of whether Kavanaugh should be a Supreme Court justice — no matter how much Democrats and Republicans might want it to.

“They’re not going to form an opinion about what they identify, they’re simply going to report that information,” Campbell said. “What happens from there is really not in their control.”

	Cepeda: Our startling level of clueless on U.S. government, civics

		
	Esther J. Cepeda
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 14, 2018 at 7:30 am | UPDATED: October 15, 2018 at 3:28 am

					In a recent multiple-choice quiz, only 13 percent knew when the U.S. Constitution was ratified; most incorrectly thought it occurred in 1776.
				

CHICAGO — You can’t throw a rock these days without hitting a book, news headline or podcast episode about the impending end of democracy.
I’m no doomsayer but, yes, it’s coming.
Not just because of increasing political polarization, the influence of corporate money on elections or any of the other usual suspects. It’ll be just plain apathy and ignorance that finally do us in.


Let’s start with these little nuggets of information. Of the 1,000 randomly selected American adults who recently took a multiple-choice quiz:
— Only 13 percent knew when the U.S. Constitution was ratified, with most incorrectly thinking it occurred in 1776.
— 60 percent didn’t know which countries the United States fought in World War II.
— 57 percent did not know how many justices serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
— Only 24 percent could correctly identify one thing Benjamin Franklin was famous for, with 37 percent believing he invented the lightbulb.
— 12 percent incorrectly thought Gen. Dwight Eisenhower led troops in the Civil War; 6 percent thought he was a commander in the Vietnam War. (He served in WWII.)
I could go on with more startling results from the quiz conducted by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation (WWNFF) but, frankly, it’s too depressing.
This level of cluelessness doesn’t just happen in a vacuum. It’s been coming on for some time as civics education has gotten crowded out of public school curricula by an increased push to get more kids proficient in reading, math and writing.
We’ll have to wait until next year to learn how our nation’s students fared on the National Assessment of Educational Progress civics assessment in 2018 — the test is administered every four years — but the 2014 test was a sad scene.
Scores among 8th graders showed no improvement from their dismal level in 2010. Less than one-quarter of students scored at the level of “proficient” or better, and only about half said they found their civics coursework interesting “often” or “always.”
No one knows where the blame lies for today’s students being low-performing in civics.
It could be anything from poor teaching to the educational trend of telling students that rote memorization is unnecessary in the age of the internet search engine. Perhaps the educational philosophy of “constructivist” learning — which means that students create their own knowledge based on their own experiences — just isn’t moving the needle.
But none of those exactly explain why, as the WWNFF’s survey noted, people 65 years and older scored the best. Only 19 percent of people under 45 passed the quiz, with 81 percent scoring a 59 percent or lower.
Ironically, there is a little-known subsection of the American population that has passed a similar test — 10 questions on U.S. civics from a pool of 100 questions — and there’s no question that they did so because passing was deeply personally meaningful to them.
I’m speaking, of course, about naturalized U.S. citizens.
They take a speaking, reading, writing and civics test as just a small part of their application for citizenship. Then, at their ceremony, they swear to support our Constitution, renounce allegiance to all other countries, and vow to bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law.
So how can we make civics and history personally meaningful to young people in school and to the adults who are navigating the governmental structures that have so much influence over nearly every aspect of their lives?
There may be no alternative. As climate change-related weather events decimate whole regions of our country, trade pacts continue to reshape the American economy and voter behavior keeps being threatened by partisan lawmaking and foreign interference, we will need to hold our elected leaders accountable for ensuring that we aren’t doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.
Whether you live in a rural area that doesn’t have adequate internet connectivity or in an urban enclave where clean, lead- and chemical-free water isn’t readily available, chances are you’re part of a community that needs to know how its government works now more than ever.

By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: March 7, 2018 at 10:56 am | UPDATED: March 7, 2018 at 11:18 am


A lawsuit accusing of fraud the founders of the former augmented-reality motorcycle helmet startup Skully has been dropped, with the woman who filed it saying a jury could conclude her claims were “totally without merit,” according to a new report.

Former Skully employee Isabelle Faithauer had alleged the Bay Area firm was a “sham” and she accused founders Marcus and Mitchell Weller of spending company money on vacations, sports cars, dining out, their San Francisco rent and a visit to a strip club.



Faithauer, who said she worked at Skully from May 2014 to December 2015, has now credited the Weller brothers with developing “a great concept for the business” and said it was “a good place to work,” according to the report.

She said after the firm let her go, she was “upset” and sued the company and the Wellers.

Though her lawsuit was based on what she understood at the time, she learned more through the legal process, she said in a statement, according to VentureBeat.

“There were many facts, documents, and information that could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that my claims were totally without merit,” Faithauer said.

“My attorney concurred in this assessment, which is one of the reasons I dismissed my claims against the Wellers.”

					
				

Marcus Weller said in a statement that he and his brother had denied their ex-employee’s claims, and called the lawsuit a “painful process,” VentureBeat reported.

There’s reason for hope among the crowd-funders who put in pre-orders for what was to be a revolutionary, $1,500 helmet with a visor that displayed directions, speed, imagery from a rear-view camera, and other data, VentureBeat reported.

The startup’s assets were sold to a Spanish company, which moved the helmet operations to Atlanta, renamed the helmet “Fenix” and is “working to ship units to the remaining customers,” VentureBeat reported.

						Zucchini bland? Not when that Italian squash is served up in the form of
zippy little zucchini pancake appetizers with feta, capers and mint. (Chris
Andre/Parties That Cook)		
	
By Bibby Gignilliat | Correspondent
PUBLISHED: July 1, 2018 at 10:00 am | UPDATED: July 2, 2018 at 3:41 am


Zucchini is a summer squash, whose peak season runs through August. On their own, zucchini can be quite bland. You just have to know how to dress them up in style! This party appetizer adds other flavorful ingredients — capers, feta, fresh lemon and herbs — to the mix for a sensational little bite.

Zucchini contains a lot of water, so for this recipe, I grate the squash and toss it in salt to remove the excess water. If the batter still seems too wet, you can always add a tablespoon more of flour. After cooking, transfer the pancakes to a cooling rack, set over a sheet pan so any excess oil can drip off. The rack allows air to circulate around the little cakes, which will keep them from getting soggy. When you’re just about ready to serve them, pop the sheet pan back in a warm oven so the pancakes can crisp up while reheating.

These cakes can be served as an appetizer, side dish or a main course for a brunch. The recipe is for appetizer-size pancakes. Just up the size for side dish or entree duty. Adding smoked salmon to the garnish will make the dish a little heartier and add even more flavor.

Zucchini Pancakes with Feta, Capers and Mint

Make 24

Ingredients:

3¾ cups coarsely grated zucchini (about 3 medium zucchini)

1½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided

2 large whole eggs

¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Yogurt topping:

½ cup Greek yogurt

¼ teaspoon fresh mint, chopped, plus more to garnish

¼ teaspoon fresh lemon juice

1/8 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:

	In a large bowl, toss the grated zucchini with ¾ teaspoon salt; let stand 10 minutes. Transfer to a sieve and press out excess liquid. Transfer zucchini to a dry bowl.
	Mix in eggs and egg yolks, flour, feta, vinegar, lemon zest and the remaining ¾ teaspoon salt.  Mix in parsley, green onions, capers and mint. If batter is very wet, add a tablespoon more flour.

(You may wish to change the oil halfway through all the batches.)
	In a small bowl combine the yogurt, mint, lemon juice and salt. Serve pancakes with a dollop of the yogurt and sprigs of mint to garnish.

LOS GATOS — Southbound Highway 17 at Highway 85 is back open for the Friday morning commute following en extended closure overnight after a tractor-trailer hauling an excavator slammed into the Blossom Hill Road overpass.

The overpass was damaged in the collision, which was reported Thursday at about 5:30 p.m., said CHP Officer Damian Cistaro.

No injuries were reported.

Engineers responded to the scene to check the overpass for structural damage.

During the closure, traffic on southbound Highway 17 was diverted to Highway 85, Cistaro said.

The CHP has also closed the Lark Avenue ramp to southbound Highway 17, Cistaro said.

An emerging group of local entrepreneurs is taking up arms against the sky-high cost of living in the Bay Area, hoping to end once and for all the housing crisis crippling the region.

 These founders, intent on disrupting the housing market and bringing down costs, are stepping in as government officials and nonprofits struggle with the enormity of the problem. Some are launching startups focused on creating new housing units, while others are working to help people buy or rent.

It’s a potentially lucrative business opportunity, targeting a sector where experts agree change is sorely needed. In some places in the Bay Area, only one-quarter of potential first-time buyers can afford a median-priced home, according to Joint Venture Silicon Valley, which studies the area’s economy. It’s no better for renters: The median cost for an apartment is more than twice as high in San Francisco as in the rest of the country.

“It’s really exciting to the see the marketplace responding to the need,” said Rufus Jeffris, vice president of communications for the Bay Area Council.

It’s exciting for investors, too, who are touting real estate tech as Silicon Valley’s next hot trend. The past few years have seen an increase in housing-related startups, as founders rush to take advantage of a prime opportunity, said Tom Cole, managing partner of Palo Alto-based Hone Capital, which has funded at least five real estate tech startups since 2015.

“Real estate is an example of the type of thing that Hone Capital loves to find,” he said, “which is a huge, huge, huge industry that is rife with inefficiencies.”

San Francisco-based startup Landed, founded by two Stanford Business School alumni, is raising money to help teachers afford down payments on homes in their school districts. Starcity is creating new housing by buying and renovating abandoned buildings and converting them into long-term rental units. HomeSlice, founded by recent UC Berkeley grads, is building a platform where groups of people can purchase a home together — making the goal of home ownership more attainable. Oakland-based Roofstock, via an online marketplace, helps landlords buy and sell single-family rental homes without displacing tenants. And Haven Connect is trying to get more people into low-income, affordable housing by streamlining the onerous application process.

“There is a lot of will out there to try to figure this out,” said Landed co-founder Alex Lofton. “I think people should feel there’s reason to be hopeful as much as there is reason to continue to be alarmed about the issue.”

Fewer than 1 percent of homes for sale in San Francisco are affordable for someone making a typical teacher’s salary of $72,000, according to a report by real estate website Trulia. That’s a major problem to Lofton, who says his company’s ultimate goal is to keep local teachers from fleeing the area in search of cheaper housing.

“If they’re all pushed out,” he said, “there’s a question of who’s going to teach our kids, and what kind of communities we’re going to live in.”

Landed splits the down payment on a home with its teacher clients — the teacher typically pays 10 percent of the home’s value, and Landed puts in another 10 percent. That money comes from investors — private institutions, like foundations, which receive equity in the house in exchange for their contribution. When the teacher later sells the house, Landed’s investors get back the 10 percent they put in, plus 25 percent of any appreciation in the home’s value. So far the company, which received $5 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative over the summer, has completed 16 home purchases in the Bay Area.

Landed helped get Maria Robinson, who teaches Spanish at Carlmont High School in Belmont, and her husband, Troy, an engineer, and their two kids out of a crowded, two-bedroom apartment and into a house. The couple makes close to $250,000 a year, enough to pay a mortgage, but they didn’t have the needed $200,000 cash on hand for a down payment on a typical home in the area.

“We wanted our own place,” Maria Robinson said. “We wanted to settle. We wanted to grow roots.”

They found a $1.1 million home in San Carlos, and with Landed contributing about $120,000 to the down payment, were able to move in Oct. 7. The 1,570 square-foot home, which has two bedrooms and a loft, wasn’t a bad deal for San Mateo County, where the median home price was $1.2 million in September, according to CoreLogic.

When they talk about their new house, the couple can’t help but get excited. It has a view of the entire Silicon Valley, Troy Robinson gushed. And it’s within walking distance of his wife’s school.

Meanwhile, Oakland-based Affordable Equity is re-imagining the landlord-tenant relationship. The six-month-old startup plans to offer its renters equity in the buildings it will buy. When Affordable Equity makes a windfall by selling property, the tenants can cash out too.

“There’s lots of wealth being created through gentrification, but if you’re a low-income renter, that’s extremely scary,” said founder Steven Taylor. “So this is a way to potentially build a boat so they can get in and have the rising tide lift their boat as well.”

Starcity is tackling the crisis from a different angle. The San Francisco-based startup buys defunct hotels, vacant commercial buildings and other unused properties, renovates them, obtains the proper city permits, and turns them into community housing, where residents have their own rooms but share common spaces. So far, the company has moved renters into two buildings in San Francisco and has another six under construction, including one expected to open in Oakland early next year.

There’s plenty of demand. The company has been in business for a year, and already has 1,800 potential renters on its waiting list.

UC Berkeley alum Anna Roumiantseva, 28, founded HomeSlice with two co-founders after the trio realized they had collectively spent about half a million dollars on rent over the past decade — and still couldn’t afford to own a home.

“We have a good education, we have good jobs, and we still can’t afford to buy,” she said. “So what does that mean for the majority of the population?”

Starting in mid-November, HomeSlice will help groups of potential homeowners navigate the hurdles and complications of collectively buying a home. HomeSlice’s website helps home buyers agree on details such as how the property will be maintained, how shares will be divided, and how decisions will be made, and then turns that information into a co-ownership agreement that can be made legally binding.

The company also helps connect clients with real estate agents and lenders, and plans to eventually roll out an online marketplace where users can buy and sell slices of homes.

“I think the notion of homeownership is going to change over the next couple years,” Roumiantseva said. “People are just fundamentally rethinking how they’re using assets, how they’re buying assets — getting more comfortable sharing.”



Startups taking on the affordable housing crisis

HomeSlice: This Berkeley-based startup makes it easier for groups of people to buy a home together. HomeSlice helps potential buyers draft a co-ownership agreement, and connects them with real estate agents and lenders.

The company plans to launch a beta test of the platform in mid-November. To learn more visit home-slice.io.

Landed: Launched in 2015 by two recent Stanford Business School grads, Landed helps Bay Area teachers afford a home in their school district. The startup connects a teacher with investors who contribute to their down payment and in return receive equity in the home. To learn more visit landed.com.

Roofstock: Oakland-based Roofstock runs an online platform where landlords can buy and sell properties in which tenants are already living. The unique business model prevents renters from getting displaced when a building changes hands.

So far the startup has sold about 1,000 homes in the Bay Area, and is operating in more than a dozen other markets around the country. To learn more visit roofstock.com.

Starcity: Starcity is tackling the Bay Area’s housing shortage by creating new rental units. The startup, launched about a year ago, buys vacant hotels, commercial buildings and other unused spaces, renovates them and converts them into communal housing. Renters have their own bedrooms, but share kitchens and other common areas. Starcity runs two buildings in San Francisco, and is developing another six. To learn more visit joinstarcity.com.

Haven Connect: This Berkeley-based startup, which launched its first pilot program in June 2016, streamlines the process of applying for affordable housing. People can apply online, quickly filling out paperwork for multiple properties at once. To learn more visit havenconnect.com.

Affordable Equity: Oakland-based Affordable Equity is pioneering a new type of landlord-tenant relationship. The startup, which is gearing up to buy single-family or small multi-unit, low-income buildings, will offer its renters equity in its properties.

By Seung Lee | slee@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: August 24, 2018 at 11:12 am | UPDATED: August 24, 2018 at 1:03 pm


Verizon will lift all data caps on public safety workers for unlimited data plans in California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii immediately after the company dramatically slowed down data speeds for Santa Clara County firefighters helping to battle the Mendocino Complex Fire.

After a maelstrom of criticism, including from California State Assemblymembers who convened a hearing on the matter Friday,Verizon will allow public safety workers, including firefighters in the four states, to have unlimited data with no price increases and data slowdowns, also known as throttling, the company said in an announcement Friday. 

Verizon also apologized for its mishap with the Santa Clara County Fire Department, in which an employee did not remove the throttling despite requests and even suggested the department pay more for a better data plan during the fire.

“In supporting first responders in the Mendocino fire, we didn’t live up to our own promise of service and performance excellence when our process failed some first responders on the line, battling a massive California wildfire,” said Verizon’s senior vice president of public sector Mike Maiorana in a statement. “For that, we are truly sorry. And we’re making every effort to ensure that it never happens again.”

The removal of data caps will apply to basic public safety workers, such as firefighters, police officers, and Emergency Medical Services personnel. Verizon extended its public safety worker classification to other federal justice agencies, including the FBI, CIA and the Secret Service, according to Tami Erwin, executive vice president of operations for Verizon Wireless.

However, there is a caveat to the new plan: Public safety workers would be throttled if they exceed their contractual data cap for the third consecutive month. If exceeded for the third straight month, data speeds would be reduced to 3G speeds, according to Erwin.

“As an example, let’s say in the first month that you use 50 gigs of data. In the second month, you use 75 gigs of data. In the third month, you use 15 gigs of data (below the 25 GB monthly threshold), then you reset and start over,” Erwin said in an interview with International Wireless Communications Expo. “So, it’s not the sum of the three but the sequential overage three months in a row that would then trigger the speed cap… It’s really intended to provide flexibility in how public safety could support first responders, in the event that they have an overage.”

However, the throttling may be waived during emergencies in the third consecutive month, Erwin said.

Erwin also noted that the new plan had been in development for more than eight months.

					
				

“This is not a reaction to Santa Clara,” said Erwin. “This is not in response to what has happened this week, but rather in response to what customers have been telling us and the increase in natural disasters that we’ve seen.”

Verizon’s new plan will roll out to all 50 U.S. states next week but was immediately granted for the four states bordering the Pacific Ocean as they fight separate natural disasters. Washington and California have been ravaged by wildfires this summer, and Hawaii is bracing for the arrival of Hurricane Lane, a Category 2 storm which has caused floods and landslides in the Big Island on Friday.

Verizon’s announcement comes before a California State Assembly committee meeting on Friday. Santa Clara County Fire Department staff, the department’s Chief Anthony Bowden and representatives from Verizon and other telecommunications companies were invited to testify at the hearing, according to Assemblymember Marc Levine, D-Marin, who co-chairs the Select Committee on Natural Disaster, Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.
“We need to know why they were throttled, why it continued and why it was not resolved,” said Levine to this news organization on Thursday. “The Mendocino Complex Fire was not a fire drill. This was unforgivable.”

					TwitchCon returns to the Bay Area. The annual convention that celebrates the social video service's community. (Twitch)
				

TwitchCon 2018 is a few weeks away from returning to the Bay Area. The three-day convention is set to descend on San Jose Oct. 26 to Oct. 28 with a mix of events and activities centered on the social media service’s video game streaming.
This is a chance for Bay Area gamers to meet famous streamers, participate in esports competitions and get a sneak peek at some upcoming games including “Fallout 76.”
For those looking at gear, several PC manufacturers will be in attendance. Alienware will bring out 46 high-end gaming rigs, showing off “Drieghan,” the new expansion for “Black Desert Online.” Lenovo is spotlighting its Legion line of PCs while Intel has a Streamer Zone, which will host 72 people who will broadcast throughout the weekend.


When it comes to esports, “Fortnite” headlines the event with the Grand Final of the Fortnite Fall Skirmish series being held at TwitchCon. At the Doritos Bowl, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 4” and its new Blackout mode take center stage. Famous players such as Ninja, Shroud, CouRage and DrLupo will captain their own teams. HP and Intel are behind the Omen Challenge, in which players have to survive a series of competitions in “PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds.” It looks as though the battle royale genre will be well-represented at TwitchCon.
For those looking to get a look at the latest games, Bethesda, Sony and Sega will be showing off their titles. “Fallout 76” is the top offering from Bethesda.

	One Play: Breaking down Washington State’s 89-yard, game-winning touchdown pass

		
	Jon Wilner
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 2, 2018 at 9:54 am | UPDATED: October 2, 2018 at 10:02 am

	Welcome to One Play, a film-room-style examination of a key play from one of the top games of the weekend.
Washington State’s 89-yard touchdown pass-and-run to beat Utah seems to fit the criteria.
Fortunately, WSU outside receivers coach Steve Spurrier Jr. was willing to spend a few minutes with the Hotline, explaining the background and details of the play the Cougars call, simply enough, ‘6-18.’


Let’s first set the scene …
WSU trailed by three points with five minutes left when it took possession deep in its own territory, following a series of stalled possessions.
After scoring 21 points and gobbling up 314 yards in the first half, the Air Raid had been held scoreless in the second (with 72 total yards).
“Both offenses played well in the first half,’’ Spurrier Jr. said. “In the second, we had some drops, and they had a good scheme. They changed up their zones. They anticipated our quick game. We had some sloppy possessions.”
This was not the time for slop:
The Cougars needed about 70 yards to attempt a reasonable game-tying field goal.
On first down, quarterback Gardner Minshew connected with receiver Tay Martin for a four-yard gain.
On second-and-six, the Cougars deployed a standard personnel package: one running back, four receivers, no tight end.
“We lined up in a 3-by-1 to the right” — three receivers to the right, one to the left — “and then sent (Travell Harris) to the (left) to identify the coverage,” Spurrier Jr. said.
“That let us know they were playing man-to-man and that Easop (Winston) would be one-on-one. When Gardner sees man-to-man, he has lots of options.”

Therein lies the simplistic beauty of Mike Leach’s offense:
The Cougars don’t have a voluminous playbook, but every running back and receiver is an option on each play.
They had run ‘6-18’ several times prior to that point, but never against the specific coverage Utah deployed on second-and-six.
The Utes were in man-bump: Man-to-man with the cornerbacks playing bump-and-run in front of Cover 1 — one safety, deep in the middle of the field, reading the quarterback’s eyes.
During his pre-snap read, Minshew saw the aggressive alignment of the cornerbacks, with Utah star Julian Blackmon on Winston to the far right.
Also working in WSU’s favor: the placement of the ball. It was on the left hashmark, creating plenty of space on the right side for Winston to work one-on-one.
At the snap, Minshew had five options:
* Martin, lined up as the outside receiver (X) on the left, would run a backside slant.
* Harris, who settled as the slot receiver to the left, mirrored Martin’s pattern with an inside slant.
* Max Borghi, the tailback, was in the backfield to Minshew’s right and would head to the flat.
* Jamire Calvin, in the slot to Minshew’s right, ran a five-yard hitch.
In other words, four of the five eligible pass catchers ran patterns within five yards of the line of scrimmage, all of them in the middle or to the left side of the field.

That opened the right side for Winston, in both the intermediate and deep zones.
Utes safety Corrion Ballard, playing Cover 1, was deep middle, reading Minshew.
“If they’re in Cover 2, it’s a much tougher because there’s a safety for the field (wide) side,” Spurrier Jr. said.
“But in Cover 1, with the single safety in the middle, it’s harder for him to get over there.
“It’s also a harder pass for Gardner if we’re lined up on the right hash, because there’s less space for him to throw into the boundary (short side).’’
On his pre-snap read, Minshew also noticed Blackmon’s position relative to Winston:
The all-conference cornerback was playing inside-out coverage, meaning he was shaded to the inside, to Winston’s left, attempting to deny anything to the middle of the field.

At the snap, Winston eluded Blackmon’s bump, then headed downfield outside the right hashmark.
“Easop was able to lean into the corner’’ — nudging Blackmon ever-so-slightly to to middle of the field — “so that he could save as much land as he could to the outside,” Spurrier Jr. said.
That movement created separation from Blackmon and a wider window for Minshew to throw a deep fade that drew Winston toward the sideline.
The ball arrived at the 35, dropping perfectly over Winston’s inside shoulder.

Winston corralled the pass several steps from the sideline. This gave him the space needed to gather, then make a move.
Blackmon lunged at Winston’s feet just after the catch, missed, and hit the turf.
That left Winston with only Ballard, arriving late, to beat.
“The first thing I did was look to see if there were any penalties,’’ Spurrier Jr. said.
“Easop isn’t a burner. He’s a 4.6-guy, but he makes guys miss. He’s crafty. He works his head and shoulders when he runs and leans well. Once he gets in space like that, he has a chance to sneak out and go all the way.”

Ballard arrived from the left, his momentum carrying him to the sideline. Winston planted his right foot hard, and angled to the middle of the field for several steps.
Ballard had no choice but to swivel his head and turn his body to the middle, his back facing Winston.
Using his forward momentum, Winston cut back to the sideline just after Ballard had swiveled to the inside and was turning to square up.

That second move, back to the outside, created the step of space Winston needed, and he blasted another 55 yards for the touchdown and a 28-24 lead with four minutes remaining.
WSU’s defense held, sealing victory No. 4.
“The difference between 4-1 and 3-2 is huge for us,’’ Spurrier Jr. said. ”There are a lot of happy Cougars.”

						A Cal Fire helicopter drops water on the Irving fire in West Marin on Tuesday.  (Alan Dep/Marin Independent Journal)
		
	
By Adrian Rodriguez | Marin Independent Journal
PUBLISHED: September 13, 2018 at 8:23 am | UPDATED: September 13, 2018 at 8:25 am


A downed power line is suspected to have ignited the 152-acre Irving fire in West Marin that forced evacuations Monday night, fire officials said.

The Irving fire, burning near the Mount Barnabe Lookout at Samuel P. Taylor State Park northwest of Lagunitas, was 80 percent contained as of late Wednesday.

Humid, cool nighttime conditions at the start of the fire gave firefighters the early advantage they needed, said Marin County fire Battalion Chief Graham Groneman.



“Monday night, we were able to put a good initial attack on that fire,” Groneman said.

“By the next morning, we had some pretty good lines in place and a pretty good stop on forward progress,” he said. “With that, the firefighters were able to take advantage of the time and the fact there was no other major fire burning actively in the area.”

September and October have traditionally been the height of the fire season, producing the dry, hot conditions that make for good fire weather, Groneman said.

A total of 83 firefighters continued the fight Wednesday, working with two water tenders, five engines and four hand crews. Crews were expected to work overnight, he said.

Regarding the cause of the fire, “we did release that the fire was caused by downed PG&E power lines,” Groneman said. “When the final investigation is complete, we’ll have more information.”

In an email, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. spokeswoman Deanna Contreras said “the safety of our customers and our communities is PG&E’s top priority. …

“We are aware that the Marin County Fire Department is investigating a power line as the cause of this fire. We’re continuing to work with the MCFD and Cal Fire to understand more about the circumstances of this preliminary finding.”

Fire investigators have blamed PG&E equipment for 12 of last year’s wildfires in Northern California’s wine country, including two that killed 15 people. PG&E is facing dozens of lawsuits from insurers that have spent billions settling insurance claims from homeowners.

The fire was reported at about 7 p.m. Monday, setting off evacuation orders for residents in Lagunitas and Forest Knolls who were directed to take shelter at the nearby San Geronimo Community Center. All evacuations were lifted around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.

Power was initially out for 150 PG&E customers, officials said.  About 50 customers were expected to remain without power until 5 p.m. Wednesday, officials said.

Tuesday afternoon the fire was reported to be about 115 acres, but after the use of GPS equipment, investigators who walked the fire line determined the correct size of the fire was 152 acres, Groneman said.

Groneman said that the San Geronimo Valley community recently participated in a community evacuation drill and said he encourages residents to be prepared with evacuation plans.

“It’s a gamechanger when it comes to saving lives in a rapidly escalating fire event,” he said.

In addition, creating defensible space “not only protects your home, but it protects the community as a whole,” he said.

In a statement, Marin County fire Chief Jason Weber said, “This fire highlights that we’re in the worst part of fire season for the North Bay.
“It’s important for residents to take key safety measures to prepare for a fire such as creating defensible space around their homes, making an evacuation checklist and registering for emergency notifications through Alert Marin.”

	London Eye: What to watch for in Raiders vs. Seahawks

LONDON — If the Raiders lose to the Seahawks, their season is effectively over. It might already be.
But to keep the slimmest of hopes alive for a monumental turnaround under Jon Gruden, the Raiders (1-4) need to put on a show for the Wembley Stadium fans when the NFL takes center stage in London at 6 p.m. local time (10 a.m. PST) on Sunday.
Here are three big things to watch for in the game.





Can the Raiders corral Russell Wilson?
The Seahawks starting quarterback is one of the best in the NFL at evading pressure and escaping the pocket.
“It all starts with the quarterback,” Gruden said Friday. “You gotta defend the play that Seattle calls, then you gotta defend the play that Russell Wilson creates. He gets out of trouble. He’s a magnificent playmaker. With Doug Baldwin healthy now, (Tyler) Lockett can still burn you in a lot of creative ways, they’re dangerous on offense. And they can run the football.”
The Raiders have really only faced two mobile quarterbacks this season, Miami’s Ryan Tannehill and Cleveland’s Baker Mayfield. Tannehill scrambled effectively – he led the Dolphins with 26 rushing yards on three carries – and both quarterbacks ignited successful passing plays with their feet. The Chargers’ Philip Rivers even escaped the pocket effectively, so that tells you all you need to know about Oakland’s ability to keep quarterbacks in the pocket.
Even they know that on Sunday, even their best efforts may not keep Wilson to a confined space.
“Going against Russell is hard. No matter what you do, he’s always gonna find those creases to get out on the perimeter, to make the big plays and that’s what he really thrives on,” Raiders linebacker Tahir Whitehead said. “That’s what really gets their team going. As a defense you go in there with a game plan to keep him in the pocket. You can try your best, but he always finds a way. On our part, we really just have to do as best as possible.”
Wilson has been sacked 18 times this season, tied for third-most among quarterbacks. The Raiders will be able to generate pressure, but can they bring him down or can Wilson escape? That might be the key to a Raiders’ bounce-back victory.
Connections galore
Plenty familiar faces to both teams will be featured in Sunday’s game, namely Marshawn Lynch in his first game against the team for which he played six years and won a Super Bowl in 2014.
The Raiders also staff Tom Cable as offensive line coach, and he was Pete Carroll’s assistant head coach and offensive line coach for seven seasons prior to re-joining the Raiders this season. Two prominent Raiders defensive linemen have also played for Seattle.
“We’ve got a few ex-Seahawks on our team, Bruce Irvin (2012-15), Clinton McDonald (2011-13) and certainly Marshawn Lynch, the most well-known ex-Seahawk on our football team,” Gruden said. “He had a lot to do, I think, with the Super Bowl ring that the Seahawks wear. He was the heart and soul of that team. In a lot of ways, he’s the heart and soul of the Raiders right now.”
On the other side, the Seahawks have Ken Norton Jr. as defensive coordinator. Raiders fans will (not so fondly) remember Norton as their defensive coordinator for two-plus seasons before Jack Del Rio fired him following the Raiders’ 33-8 loss to the Patriots last year.
“Kenny and I go way back to when he was finishing up his career at San Francisco and I was there a couple years,” Carroll said this week. “When I left there and wound up at USC, I ran into Kenny down in L.A. at the NFL Network and asked him about coming into coach, so he entered in as a graduate assistant way back when. I’ve been with Kenny for a good while and I‘ve always admired his manner and the way in how he dealt with people, how he loved the game and the spirit that he brought. When I didn’t have him around there was a void (Norton coached Seattle’s linebackers from 2010-14 under Carroll), so I was thrilled to get him back and get his competitiveness and toughness back on our club.”
The Seahawks’ most notable ex-Raider, though, is their kicker, 18-year Raider Sebastian Janikowski. Gruden opted not to bring the lefty back as an unrestricted free agent this offseason. He’s 6-for-9 on field goals this season with a long of 56 yards.
“They got a kicker that I know extremely well,” Gruden said with a big grin. “Sebastian Janikowski. I can’t wait to see him as well.”
“He’s been great to have on the club,” Carroll said of Janikowski. “He’s been a great worker, tremendous competitor, he’s come through with some big kicks already and given us a lot of confidence.”
Of lesser significance, former Raiders defensive line coach Jethro Franklin is now an assistant defensive line coach for the Seahawks.

Lynch has received 77 carries this season, seventh-most in the NFL, but Gruden wants to feed him more.
Lynch is only averaging 4.3 yards per carry (23rd in the league), but his running style that hasn’t faded with age wears defenses down. Against a Seattle defense led by linebacker Bobby Wagner, Lynch’s former teammate, you bet Lynch will bring the heat in London.
“He’s still running with that incredible physicality. He’s been durable, he’s practiced every day,” Gruden said. “Behind the scenes, he’s one of our leaders. He’s a little bit misunderstood by a lot of people, but believe me if you were coaching a football team he’d be one of the first guys you’d want on your team.”

Lynch has three touchdowns this season, all from within 10 yards, and probably would’ve had a fourth if Gruden called a running play on 1st-and-goal from the 1 against the Chargers last Sunday. So, a week after he only ran Lynch nine times as the Raiders resorted to the air down big, does Gruden think Beast Mode needs the ball more?
“Probably,” Gruden said. “We got a lot of guys that need to see the ball more … Good is not good enough. We need to start playing great offensively, and to do that we need to see more of Lynch. We need to see a little bit more of the ball going across the goal line. That’s the big thing.”

By Robert Salonga | rsalonga@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: March 27, 2018 at 2:40 pm | UPDATED: March 28, 2018 at 6:48 am


SAN JOSE — Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith acknowledged Tuesday that federal immigration agents were “mistakenly” allowed to interview jail inmates earlier this month in violation of the county’s sanctuary policies, around the same time a similar headline-grabbing incident occurred in San Francisco.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were let inside the Main Jail in San Jose and Elmwood men’s jail in Milpitas on March 7 and 8, the Sheriff’s Office said. They interviewed four inmates, but did not detain anyone.

It was unclear why the inmates were selected and contacted, but federal authorities described the interviews as a routine part of the Criminal Alien Program that targets undocumented residents with criminal records.

The entry revelation, first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, raised the hackles of immigration advocates and prompted contrition from Smith who described it as an oversight, rather than a rogue move by jail staff upset with the county’s stance against direct cooperation with ICE.

“The County of Santa Clara has a policy of not cooperating with ICE operations,” Smith said in a statement. “The Sheriff’s Office does not accept ICE holds and has a longstanding policy of not allowing ICE agents access to our custody facilities. Unfortunately, a few weeks ago staff mistakenly permitted ICE entrance into our jail. Inmates were interviewed, but none were detained by ICE.”

In the wake of the policy violation, the Sheriff’s Office said jail deputies and staff were re-briefed of the sanctuary policies, which were developed with the aim of maintaining trust in immigrant communities and ensuring residents are not afraid to report crimes. Officials said fliers affirming the policies were posted in high-traffic areas for staff, inmates, and visitors to see.

“We value the trust and rapport we’ve earned with our local immigrant community and we will not break that trust,” Smith said.

Smith’s statement was reminiscent of the about-face offered by San Francisco Sheriff Vicki Hennessy when it was revealed earlier this month that ICE agents accessed that city and county’s jails March 8.

Smith said her agency has revamped entry procedures for police and law enforcement at the county jails, including separating them from the general sign-in procedures, requiring them to more explicitly identify themselves, and more fully explain who they’re visiting and why to jail staff.

					
				

Still, immigration advocates who have been working around the clock to advise and protect undocumented residents and their families were distressed by the ICE agents’ recent access.

“It’s particularly shocking that this may have occurred in Santa Clara County jails as our local policy clearly states that, absent a criminal warrant, ICE cannot be given access to individuals or use county facilities for interviews,” said Maricela Gutiérrez, executive director of the Services, Immigrant Rights, and Education Network.

Gutiérrez added that it only causes confusion for the immigrant communities that South Bay law enforcement like the Sheriff’s Office and the San Jose Police Department have worked to convince that they do not enforce immigration laws. State law also prohibits ICE interviews with inmates without their prior written consent.

“Not only may the jail have violated its own policy, it has only deepened mistrust with local law enforcement and how the county communicates with ICE about those apprehended,” she said.

The Sheriff’s Office also noted that immigration agents tried to enter a county jail facility on March 14 and were denied. Agents tried again Monday, she said, by attempting to enter at two separate points of the same facility, but were also rebuffed. Officials said that the frequency of their presence in the past month was “unusual.”

The ICE visits that violated the county’s sanctuary policies also happened at the same time U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions visited Sacramento, a visit during which he roundly rejected the sanctuary policies of Bay Area communities including San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Alameda Counties as well as Oakland and San Jose.

ICE Deputy Director Thomas D. Homan has similarly excoriated Bay Area and California leaders for their sanctuary stances.

“Sanctuary policies, which have pushed ICE out of jails, force our officers to conduct more enforcement in the community — which poses increased risks for law enforcement and the public,” Homan said in a statement released Tuesday.

“It also increases the likelihood that ICE will encounter other illegal aliens who previously weren’t on our radar. It is nonsensical to demand that ICE solely focus on criminals, while simultaneously preventing ICE from arresting criminal aliens inside the secure confines of local jails.”

The Sheriff’s Office said the ICE agents likely were allowed entry in early March because jail deputies deferred to law-enforcement officers as part of routine courtesy without immediately realizing why they were there.

Amy Le, president of the Santa Clara County Correctional Peace Officers’ Association, said jail deputies and staff were not trying to circumvent sanctuary policies. In making her plea, she cited her own experience as an immigrant and the diversity of the correctional staff.

“Nobody intentionally tried to help ICE,” she said. “We take our jobs and inmates’ rights seriously. We have so many people visiting, that human error does happen. We made a mistake, and we’ll learn from it.”

Le echoed Smith’s statement in declaring that jail staff has “tightened up on traffic and people coming in to visit,” and asked for the public’s patience when this new diligence causes delays in admitting jail visitors.

“Visitors may get upset, but protection of inmate rights and state law is very important to us,” she said. “We honor the law. It doesn’t matter if you’re an inmate or visitor, we do our best to protect everyone.”

The sanctuary policy snafu provided more fodder for those who have questioned Smith’s running of the jails, which has come into particular focus since the 2015 beating death of mentally ill inmate Michael Tyree, which led to murder convictions for three jail deputies. The county has since approved the creation of an independent monitor to audit and evaluate jail and Sheriff’s Office operations.

Among those critics is retired undersheriff John Hirokawa, who as Smith’s second-in-command was once chief of the Department of Correction. He seized on the news to fuel his bid to unseat his former boss’s run at a sixth term in June.

“Laurie Smith has asked us to overlook similar breaches of trust as ‘a mistake’, ‘human error’, and ‘non-intentional,’ ” Hirokawa said in a statement. “In doing so, her reactionary leadership has diminished the standard of behavior across the department.”

By The Associated Press | 
PUBLISHED: September 20, 2018 at 12:04 pm | UPDATED: September 20, 2018 at 1:56 pm


Update: Authorities corrected the victim count, saying eight people were dead, including four who are in the U.S. illegally. They initially said nine were dead, seven of whom were in the U.S. illegally.

PHOENIX (AP) — Eight people, including four who were in the U.S. illegally, were killed in a head-on collision on an Arizona highway, authorities said Thursday.

The crash occurred around 10 p.m. Wednesday when a car struck an SUV carrying nine people on State Route 79 south of Florence and about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said.

The agency has declined to say whether the SUV was being used as part of a smuggling operation or may have been connected to a government immigration facility near Florence.

Investigators don’t know the cause of the crash. The southbound car, a Buick, had crossed the center line and struck the SUV, which was northbound.

Officials say the SUV’s driver and front-seat passenger were U.S. citizens, but seven others in the vehicle were immigrants in the country illegally.

The driver, front-seat passenger and four immigrants in the SUV were killed. Three other immigrants were taken to hospitals.

The driver and front-seat passenger in the Buick also were killed.

PUBLISHED: September 19, 2018 at 4:27 pm | UPDATED: September 20, 2018 at 4:13 am


Political momentum for a crackdown on Silicon Valley’s social media giants got a boost this week when a state attorney general said he would tell U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions next week that Google, Facebook and Twitter should be broken up.

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry wants the federal government to do to the social media firms what it did to Standard Oil in 1911, according to a Louisiana newspaper report Tuesday.



The government smashed up Standard using antitrust laws, forcing it to break into 34 business pieces. Landry is accusing the tech behemoths of suppressing conservative views and stifling competition, on top of infringing on antitrust laws, The Advocate reported.

“This can’t be fixed legislatively,” Landry told the paper. “We need to go to court with an antitrust suit.”



He or another high official from his office will next week present the break-up proposal to Sessions at a meeting that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is expected to attend.

Landry, president of the National Association of Attorneys General, had spent months with his colleagues probing what they described as anti-competitive practices by Facebook, Google and Twitter, according to the paper. The decision to push for a break-up of the social media companies came after Landry and his fellow attorneys general heard many complaints that companies routinely froze out conservative views, deliberately or accidentally, The Advocate reported.

Twitter declined to comment on Landry’s accusations and planned solution. Facebook and Google — whose subsidiary YouTube has been accused of censoring right-wing content — did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Early this month, after President Donald Trump claimed on Twitter that social media companies were “totally discriminating” against Republicans and conservatives, Sessions announced he would bring in a group of state attorneys general to examine whether firms like Google, Facebook and Twitter were “intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas,” The Washington Post reported.

					
				

But Becerra was among Democrat state attorney generals not invited to the meeting.

However, after pushback over the restricted invitations, Sessions’ Department of Justice announced last week that the meeting would include a bipartisan group of 24 attorneys general, and take place Sept. 25. Becerra is planning to attend.

The Justice Department, Becerra said in a statement, “has responded to our request that states with interests involving the future and oversight of social media platforms be included in any discussion of this subject.



“States like California, the nation’s tech leader and home to a $385 billion tech industry, have a wealth of insight and expertise to share in any inquiry about the role of technology companies and we look forward to a thoughtful conversation in Washington, DC.”

	Can you get the flu shot too early?

		
	Karen D'Souza

It’s time to start lining up for flu shot already folks, according to the CDC. Sure, it still feels like summer. It’s still warm enough to lounge around the pool and you still need to slather on the sunscreen or risk getting a nasty burn.
But the CDC advises that all adults and children (older than six months) should get a flu vaccine by the end of October. Getting vaccinated before flu season strikes may well offer the best protection, says the CDC. But not everyone agrees that’s the best plan, especially for senior citizens.
“You should get a flu vaccine before flu begins spreading in your community,” says the CDC. “It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies that protect against flu to develop in the body, so make plans to get vaccinated early in fall.”


Phamacist Prakash Deshpande injects a patient with influenza vaccine at a Manhattan pharmacy. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) However, the timing of the shot is not a cut-and-dried issue. Certainly there are those who worry about getting the shot too early so that their immunity wears off long before the gnarly flu months of January and February hit in full force. Some studies suggest vaccines lose protectiveness during the course of a single flu season. In people over 65, as NPR reports, the protective effect may wear off faster than it does in young people. Seniors may want to mull it over before they do the early bird thing.
“The data are very mixed,” says Dr. John J. Treanor, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Rochester medical school. “So some might worry that if [they] got vaccinated very early and flu didn’t show up until very late, it might not work as well,” he told NPR. But other studies show “you still have protection from the shot you got last year,” Treanor adds, “if it’s a year when the strains didn’t change.”
It should also be noted that the flu shot is far from perfect. Last year it was only about 36% effective. However, the shot, which has been tweaked in the hopes of targeting current strains of the virus, is usually more effective in children. The good news is that both standard vaccines and nasal sprays are recommended for the 2018-2019 flu season.
The CDC notes the possibility that “delaying vaccination might permit greater immunity later in the season,” but it maintains that “deferral could result in missed opportunities to vaccinate.”
The vaccine reminder comes after last year’s particularly intense flu season,  which according to the Academy of Pediatrics was the third most severe since 2003–2004 and  the first to be classified as high severity for all age groups.

More than 700,000 people were hospitalized with the flu during last season and about 180 children died, CNBC points out. About 80 percent of the children who died from the flu last season weren’t vaccinated.There’s no way to predict what this year’s flu season will be like, but the usual precautions should be taken. In addition to getting the shot, wash your hands, cover your cough and stay home from school or work if you do get sick. Stocking up on cough drops and tissue won’t hurt either.

WATCH: 49ers post-game analysis by reporter Dieter Kurtenbach.  

 
 

It was a calamity. 

It was an embarrassment. 

It was a downright waste of time. 

But more than anything else, it was a reminder — a stark, oh-so-painful reminder — that successful NFL teams are more than a star quarterback and a few solid defenders. 

No sir, good NFL teams go 53 men deep, and it takes time, skill, and a bit of luck, to put together a playoff-worthy roster. 

And these 49ers — with or without Jimmy Garoppolo — are not even close to that level. 

					
				

(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) 
Of course, there was a time when we thought that they were. Garoppolo’s late-season play made it easy to forget that the 49ers lost their first nine games last year — the first season of a multi-year rebuilding plan. 

And because Garoppolo won all five of his starts at the end of last year — covering up a lot of holes in the process — there was a lot of excitement about this 49ers team coming into 2018. Remember the all the talk about them making the playoffs? 

(Oh, to be young and naive again.) 

That gilding was starting to show cracks before Garoppolo tore his ACL in Kansas City last month, but it’s completely gone after Sunday’s loss to previously winless Cardinals at home, despite running 43 more offensive plays and earning 23 more first downs in the contest. 

Losing to arguably the worst team in the NFL, in the manner the 49ers did Sunday, is an indictment: this team doesn’t have enough talent, across the board, to be respectable this season. 

Add in the fact that this team can’t seem to get out of its own way, and you’ve set the table for up to 11 more servings of pain and misery. 
(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) 

Sunday’s game made me question if I had time traveled — was it 2017 again? 

Because the loss to the Cardinals had more than a few characteristics of last season: C.J. Beathard was throwing behind receivers, holding onto the ball too long and then giving it away far too often. Around Beathard, receivers couldn’t separate and when they did get the ball, far too often it bounced off their hands (or chests, or helmets). The defense was solid in some areas, but it couldn’t create a pass rush and gave up contest-defining big plays in the pass game. 

The only clear areas of year-to-year appreciation for these Niners is the offensive line (which went from horrific to meh), Matt Breida going from good to really good, and having cornerback Richard Sherman out on the field. Maybe the linebackers are better, too. 

That’s it. 

Injuries, of course, play a big role in all of this. That obviously starts with Garoppolo, but goes far deeper than that. 

The Niners entered this season with a top-heavy roster, and a disporportinate number of those top-level players are banged up: Breida, Sherman, four of the five starting offensive linemen, and tight end George Kittle look as if they’ll play the whole season with some sort of injury; Marquise Goodwin, the team’s best receiver and one proven big-play threat has been a non-factor this season, thanks to two different lower-body injuries; rookie receiver Dante Pettis, who had a chance to have a big role for this team, is battling a knee injury that’s likely to keep him out for another game or two; and, of course, the season-changing ACL tears of Garoppolo and running back Jerick McKinnon. 

The margin for error in the NFL is already minuscule, but with 49ers’ copious and inopportune injuries, that margin disappears. 

And when you turn the ball over five times in conjunction with that, as Beathard and the Niners did Sunday, you get soundly beaten by a winless and embarassingly bad Arizona team at home. 

The 49ers needed injury luck to be on their side this season. Fate seems to be punishing this team, though — perhaps as a repayment for the fortune the 49ers found in getting, and then succeeding, with Garoppolo last year. 

“Guys are frustrated. Our guys are working. They’re putting in a lot of work in and when you go through some of that stuff, it’s tough,” Shanahan said Sunday. “We’re all competitive people and we want things to change, and we know it will.” 

And perhaps it will… next year, when Garoppolo comes back. 
(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) 

In the meantime, this lost season — and make no mistake, that’s what this is — can be useful. You’ll just have to find value in things well beyond wins and losses. Yes, the rest of this 2018 season is about establishing viable depth for 2019. 

The Niners will likely have some high draft picks and some serious money to throw around to free agents in this upcoming offseason (which cannot come soon enough), but half of this current roster — maybe more — needs to prove that they’re worthy of keeping around for 2019 and beyond. 

The final 11 games of the season can serve as an extended audition for players like Richie James and Kendrick Bourne — can they prove themselves to be viable NFL receivers in the coming months? 

Can Solomon Thomas finally live up to the potential that — right or wrong — comes along with being the No. 3 overall pick? 

Can Reuben Foster and Fred Warner form a formidable linebacker core that will anchor the Niners defense for the next half decade? 

Can cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon bounce back from a miserable start to the year and re-establish the hype that surrounded him during the preseason? 

Is Beathard a reliable NFL quarterback, even as a backup? After two weeks — one up, one down — that’s been thrown back into question. 

Shanahan and Lynch deserve judgment for this year as well — not just in conjunction with the performances with the aforementioned players, but for how Shanahan adapts his plans week-to-week and how Lynch manages the trade deadline and a bottom-end of a roster that will likely be constantly in flux over the next few months.

All of this stuff might sound familiar. It should — this is part of the rebuilding process. 

And if a good deal of it goes right — if young guys step up and the Niners can find a few more depth pieces to go with the top-end pieces they already have — this team should be in a much better position to actually contend for the playoffs next year. 

It’s not fun — it’s not what many (including myself) expected for 2018 — but it’s a silver lining. 

Hold onto it — the rest of this Niners’ season looks like it will be miserable without it.

By Jon Wilner | jwilner@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: October 14, 2018 at 9:54 am | UPDATED: October 14, 2018 at 7:05 pm


Highlights from the ballot …

*** LSU jumped back into the No. 2 spot — a position it held earlier in the season — after the dominating victory over Georgia.

The Tigers have now beaten Georgia, Miami and Auburn, each of which was ranked in the top 10 at the time of kickoff.

Although Miami and Auburn have taken on losses recently, those are quality secondary victories compared to those of other teams.

The depth of LSU’s resume, in other words, trumps all others. (That includes Alabama’s, but I’m not prepared to remove the Crimson Tide from the top spot on SOS grounds.)

*** Michigan jumped six places, to No. 8, after the wipeout of Wisconsin.

Clearly, the Badgers aren’t the same team defensively that they’ve been in recent years — and clearly, they aren’t as good as I expected — but the Wolverines are playing as well as anyone without Crimson in its name.

*** Oregon joined Michigan in climbing into the top 10 after the win over Washington.

I now have the Ducks slotted No. 9, which (by coincidence) is exactly the spot they occupied in my preseason ballot.

					
				

That was 15 positions higher than their overall preseason ranking, the source of intense mockery, especially from fans of a certain team to the North.

But Oregon has performed exactly as I expected, with the exception of a certain outcome on Sept. 22.

*** Staying in the Pac-12 for a moment …

USC returned to the ballot following a convincing victory over Colorado, but that wasn’t the only reason for the Trojans’ positioning:

Their loss to Texas doesn’t look nearly as bad now as it did at the time, while the win over Washington State has gained a bit of heft.

Meanwhile, WSU is No. 23 this week despite being idle.

The reason: I’ve now seen enough from Utah to count the Cougars’ head-to-head win as a quality victory for the Cougars — their best result is no longer a loss at USC.

*** Another newcomer this week: Texas A&M.

The Aggies are 5-2 after winning at South Carolina.

Their losses, for those who haven’t followed closely, are to Alabama (by the same lopsided margin everybody experiences against the Tide) and to Clemson (by two).

			It wasn't that long ago, actually. Thoughts of a winless season began dancing after the awful home loss to Fresno State in Week Three, then gained steam after the second-half collapse at Colorado in Week Five. The dread was partly rooted in reality, what with the rugged schedule and the self-destructive tendencies and the personnel flaws and the rookie quarterback...

					A barn in the 3300 block of Grizzly Island Road is surrounded by the burn scar of the Branscombe Fire. The fast moving grass fire that started late Sunday morning consumed more than 4,500 acres and destroyed one residence, two vehicles and one barn.

A fast-moving fire burning Sunday in southern Solano County had raged to 4,000 acres, with heavy smoke from the blaze blowing throughout the Bay Area, before firefighters received a much-needed change in the weather conditions.
Firefighters from several jurisdictions — aircraft from Cal Fire, plus crews from Suisun City, Montezuma, Benicia, American Canyon, Vallejo and Travis Air Force Base — fought the blaze all day, and by nightfall had good news to report: 70 percent containment.

“The sun went down. The wind stopped blowing. And the head of the fire burned into the Suisun Marsh,” Dennis Rein of the Suisun Fire Protection District told the Bay Area News Group.
It was a strong turnaround from the afternoon, when high winds hampered efforts to gain the upper hand.
The fire had started south of Travis Air Force Base near Branscombe Road just before 11 a.m., and was driven south by high winds, Don Ryan of the Solano County Office of Emergency Services said Sunday evening in a video update posted to Facebook. The fire jumped Highway 12, and burned south through the Potrero Hills area and then headed toward the Grizzly Island Wildlife Area, near the southern edge of the county.
“We’ve had a few structure losses, as well as a few vehicles that have been burned,” Ryan reported.

 
No evacuations were ordered, though authorities late Sunday night were still asking people to stay away from the area where the fire is burning to allow crews to access the area more easily.
A portion of Highway 12 near Walters Road was closed in both directions earlier Sunday when the flames were nearby, but reopened just before 1 p.m.

Throughout the day, smoke was reported drifting throughout Contra Costa, Alameda, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties as a result of the blaze, and some dark ash was spotted in Walnut Creek and Concord. In southern Contra Costa, the smoke prompted San Ramon Little League officials to cancel Sunday games.
The Contra Costa County Fire Protection District sent a tweet to concerned members of the public explaining that the heavy smoke was due to the four-alarm fire in Solano County and urging residents not to call 911 for that.
For the whole region, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued an air quality advisory that will be in effect through Monday. Residents are urged to stay indoors if affected by the smoke.

Earlier in the day, a portion of Highway 505 was shut down after a brush fire broke out along the route, according to the California Highway Patrol.That fire, near Vaca Valley Parkway, closed down connecting ramps to Interstate 80 for about an hour before they were reopened, Bay City News Service reported.
Parts of the Bay Area remained under a red flag warning from the National Weather Service through 9 a.m. Monday. High winds of 25 to 35 miles per hour, and gusts that could reach 55 miles per hour, along with low humidity and warm daytime temperatures were creating the potential for critical fire weather conditions in the region.

PUBLISHED: October 8, 2018 at 1:03 pm | UPDATED: October 9, 2018 at 11:07 pm


Menlo Park is home to a new hotel … and a new restaurant.

Today, Oak + Violet will make its debut at the Park James Hotel, a new boutique property on El Camino Real.

Executive chef Mike Gadd and general manager Reed Woogerd will oversee all of the culinary offerings at the hotel, from full service at the restaurant and the courtyard bar to the corporate/private dining functions.

Both come to the Bay Area from Columbus, Ohio. Gadd’s 15-year résumé includes Veritas, L’Entibes and other locally prominent high-end restaurants. Woogerd was formerly president of the Corso Ventures restaurant group.

At Oak & Violet, they’ll focus on California’s agricultural bounty with a seasonal, locally sourced menu. Inaugural offerings include a Stuffed Whole Branzino Romesco with roasted fennel, artichokes, olives and peppers; Fall Quinoa & Honey Crisp Apple Salad; the vegan Impossible Slider; and such shared bites as Pacific oysters, charcuterie and beef tartare.

Signature sips featured on the craft cocktail menu are the El Camino, with El Silencio mezcal, aperol, fresh grapefruit and lime, and rosemary; and the Violet, a limoncello, bubbly and blueberry concoction.

						President Donald Trump is arguing that social media companies are discriminating against conservatives. “Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen,” he wrote on Twitter.

By David Nakamura | Washington Post

BRIDGEWATER, N.J. — President Donald Trump on Saturday waded into the growing debate over the role of social media companies in policing public discourse, accusing them of “totally discriminating” against Republicans and conservative commentators.

In a series of morning tweets from his private resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, the president suggested the companies, which he did not name specifically, were engaging in censorship.

“Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen,” Trump wrote. He added that “mistakes are being made” and vowed that his administration “won’t let that happen.”


Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices. Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won’t let that happen. They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others…….

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2018





…..Censorship is a very dangerous thing & absolutely impossible to police. If you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC, & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed. I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don’t watch at all..

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2018

					
				





….Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen. Who is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made. Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2018




The president’s remarks came two weeks after YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Facebook took down web pages operated by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, a Trump supporter whose radio show the president appeared on during the 2016 campaign. Twitter followed suit this week in suspending Jones’ account for posting a show that violated the platform’s rules against violent threats.

Social media companies, with platforms that reach hundreds of millions, have been the focus of an intensifying debate over their responsibility to limit the spread of misinformation. Online activists have targeted Jones and others, forcing some advertisers to drop support of the programs.

In his tweets, Trump said it was “absolutely impossible to police” the sites and, as he has done often, suggested that mainstream news organizations whose coverage he does not like are “Fake News.”

The president has lashed out angrily at the ongoing investigation from special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia’s alleged influence campaign in the 2016 election, including potential ties to the Trump campaign. Among other things, Russian operatives have been accused of spreading false information through ads on Facebook.

In another tweet, the president said that it wasn’t just Russia that might try to meddle.

“All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China,” Trump tweeted Saturday. “But in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone!”

			The nation's top health official proposed on Monday that pharmaceutical companies be required to include the list price of medicines in television advertisements to consumers -- the boldest in a series of efforts by the Trump administration to curb rampant drug spending.

			The letter says the list includes the names of all priests credibly accused in the past 70 years. It includes 28 priests of the archdiocese and three priests not based in the archdiocese but who worked in its schools or parishes. The three were members of religious orders, or independent communities.

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

CONCORD — Authorities on Tuesday identified a woman stabbed to death and found dead at a shopping center last week.

Debbie Shandrew, 58, of Concord, was dead when a security guard doing his afternoon rounds on Aug. 22 discovered her in a fenced-in area at the center in the 2700 block of Clayton Road, near Oakland Avenue. Police believe she was killed around sunrise.

The Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office on Monday charged Rickie Keefer Sr., 58,  of Antioch, with murder, along with an enhancement charge for allegedly using a knife. The charge also carries an enhancement allegation against Keefer because of his robbery conviction out of Illinois in 1983.

Police arrested Keefer after viewing several security cameras in the area that showed a person believed to be Keefer coming and going from the crime scene, as well as the vehicle he was believed to be using. Security cameras did not capture video of slaying, police said, but audio from one of the cameras recorded Shandrew screaming for her life.

Rickie Keefer, 58, has been charged with murder, along with an enhancement, in the death of Concord resident Debbie Shandrew. 
Concord police Lt. Mike Kindorf called the killing “particulary heinous.”

A day after the crime, a Concord police sergeant on patrol spotted the vehicle parked and found a man inside who matched Keefer’s description. Police believe Keefer was living out of his car.

Keefer also has a burglary conviction out of Illinois, as well as burglary, theft and drug-related convictions in California. He remains in the county jail in Martinez in lieu of $2.16 million bail.

The homicide was the fourth in the city of Concord in 2018.

	Pitts: President Trump, what do you want people to say at your own funeral?

		
	Leonard Pitts Jr - Miami Herald
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 4, 2018 at 6:52 am | UPDATED: September 4, 2018 at 7:04 am

					It's only human to wonder how President Trump will remembered.
				

Dear Donald Trump:
Do you ever think about your own funeral?
The question is not meant to be morbid or to wish ill upon you. But given how churlishly you have behaved after the death of Sen. John McCain — was it really that hard for you to issue a laudatory statement and lower the flag in his honor? — it feels appropriate. Besides, it’s only human to wonder how you’ll be remembered once you exhale for the final time.


Indeed, Martin Luther King famously mused about his funeral just two months before he was killed. “Every now and then,” he told his congregation, “I ask myself what is it that I would want said?”
The band Crash Test Dummies pondered the question in a ballad called “At My Funeral.” “When my coffin is sealed and I’m safely six feet under,” the singer intoned, “perhaps my friends will see fit then to judge me.”
The things that are being said of McCain are mostly the kinds of things one would want said, the judgments of his friends mostly flattering. We are hearing tales of duty, honor and puckish humor. His lapses in judgment? His mistakes and unworthy moments? Only journalists are rude enough to recall those, and even we won’t make too much of it — not now, at least. In death, after all, one is forgiven.
Usually.
The qualifier is necessary because, as you have been a breaker of norms in so many other ways, you will likely be one in death. Royalty from the worlds of politics, sports and entertainment are gathering to honor McCain. Will a similar panoply of greatness follow you to your final rest? It’s doubtful.
Two ex-presidents agreed to eulogize McCain, a man with whom neither was personally very close, but whom both regarded with respect. It’s hard to imagine any ex-presidents giving your eulogy. So, who do you think they’ll get?
Kid Rock? Vladimir Putin?
And what will they say?
When President Gerald Ford died, President Jimmy Carter thanked him “for all he did to heal our land.” No one can say that of you.
When President Ronald Reagan died, President George W. Bush noted that he “carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with a decency and attention to small kindnesses . . .” Something else no one can say about you.
With so many of your friends lining up to testify against you, who will even be left to mourn, outside of your kids and whomever you happen to be married to at the time? Will Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort be out on parole by then? Will Don Jr.?
Maybe Stormy Daniels will be there, signing autographs and taking selfies with her fans. Maybe David Duke will show up and burn a cross in your honor. Maybe Sean Spicer will stand out front and announce that, “This will be the largest audience to witness a funeral, period, both in person and around the world.” Point being, there will be little mourning of the kind we’re seeing for John McCain.
You see, the thing is, we write our own eulogies. Someone else delivers it, yes, but each of us authors his own in the life he lives and the memories he leaves. But despite having 72 years to work on it, the eulogy you’ve written thus far is meager and pathetic, your rise to the presidency and alleged billions in net worth notwithstanding.
Your inability to muster even a simulacrum of basic decency at the passing of an authentic American hero diminishes your eulogy even more. There’s cautionary wisdom here, if only you had the wit to understand it.
As is true of us all, Donald Trump, your funeral is coming. You’ve probably never thought about that.
This would be a good time to start.

	Vote now: Best Bay Area pizza? Here’s the Sizzling 16

					It's a race to the finish for our Best Bay Area Pizza bracket challenge.
				

Whether you’re a San Jose thin-crust fan or a Berkeley deep-dish devotee, there’s no question that the Bay Area’s pizza scene is primo. But which one is the Perfect Pie?
Last week, we asked readers to be judge, jury and eater — and help us choose the best of the Bay Area’s pizzas, bracket-style. We offered up 32 tasty high-quality pizzas, nominated by readers, from the doughy goodness of Tony’s to Pizza My Heart, Pizza Boca Lupo and Pizzeria Delfina.
Now the votes are in — and the Savory 16 include some surprises.


San Jose’s gourmet Pizzeria 408 beat out Walnut Creek’s like-minded Pancoast Pizza, while Berkeley’s Zachary’s earned twice as many votes as equally-beloved Lucia’s. Jake’s of Saratoga pulled a massive upset when it bested San Jose’s cult-favorite Frankie, Johnny and Luigi Too, while Bibo’s NY Pizza went crust-to-crust against Oakland’s Dimond Slice, before emerging triumphant with four times the votes.

So what happens next? That’s up to you, pizza fans. We’re down to 16 yummy contenders. Cast your votes in the brackets below using Firefox or Safari as your browser — Chrome is being problematic and trying to hog all the pizza for itself — and be sure to click the “done” button when you’re finished to submit your votes. Voting is open from now until noon on Thursday, June 21. We’ll unveil the Elite Eight next Monday morning.

					The new women of "Charmed": Madeleine Mantock as Macy Vaughn, Melonie Diaz as Mel Vera and Sarah Jeffery as Maggie Vera.
				

TV picks for Sunday, Oct. 14
WATCH THIS:
“Sunday Night Football” (5:20 p.m.): This looks like a good one. Young quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who has been lighting up the NFL, leads his undefeated Kansas City Chiefs into Foxborough, Mass., to face the old pro Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in an AFC showdown. Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth call the action.
“Supergirl” (8 p.m., The CW): Diving back into reporting, Kara welcomes a new cub reporter to CatCo.  Meanwhile, James and Lena argue about James’ impending indictment for acting as the vigilante Guardian, while Alex and Brainy (Jesse Rath) struggle to get in sync at the DEO.  Supergirl is called into action when remnants of the anti-alien terrorist organization Cadmus try to assassinate pro-alien leaders, but their endgame turns out to be much more sinister than she expected.  J’onn relishes his peaceful new life, but an outing with an old friend causes him concern.
“The Circus” (8 p.m., Showtime): In the wake of a bruising Supreme Court confirmation battle, the series travels to California, the heart of the anti-Trump “Resistance” movement, to analyze post-Kavanaugh politics ahead of the November election. Home to several 2020 presidential hopefuls and more competitive House races than any other state, California is uniquely poised to play an outsized role in this year’s midterms — and Democrats’ ongoing efforts to oppose the Trump presidency.


“Charmed” (9 p.m., The CW): TV’s reboot craze continues with this new take on the supernatural saga. After the tragic death of Mel (Melonie Diaz) and Maggie’s (Sarah Jeffery) mother, the sisters struggle with moving forward but face another huge shock when they learn they have an older sister, Macy (Madeleine Mantock).  With the emotions of all three sisters running high, each of the girls suddenly exhibit impossible new abilities: Mel can freeze time, Maggie starts hearing others’ thoughts and Macy has telekinetic powers. While trying to understand their new powers, Harry Greenwood (Rupert Evans), gathers the sisters and reveals they’re actually powerful witches, as was their mother.
“Shark Tank” (9 p.m., ABC): Brothers from Orange County introduce a product that solves the issue of pet shedding; an entrepreneur from Scottsdale, Arizona, believes he has invented a better way to carry a child’s car seat; an entrepreneur from Los Angeles presents her solution to a problem some well-endowed women face.
David Tennant and Jennifer Garner in “Camping.” “Camping” (10 p.m., HBO): Jennifer Garner returns to series television in this offbeat comedy. She plays an obsessive control  freak who organizes a family-and-friends great outdoors trip for her husband’s (David Tennant) 45th birthday. Of course, things go hilariously awry.
“Itzhak Perlman: American Masters” (10 p.m., PBS): This new documentary provides an intimate and unprecedented cinéma vérité look at the legendary violinist through interviews with his fellow performers and friends, including Billy Joel, Alan Alda, pianist Martha Argerich, cellist Mischa Maisky, and his wife of 50 years, Toby Perlman.
“The Alec Baldwin Show” (10 p.m., ABC):  Alec Baldwin brings his unfiltered, provocative interview styles to this new prime-time talk show. Producers promise “in-depth, intimate and candid one-on-one conversations” with celebrities and cultural icons. First up: Robert De Niro, and Taraji P. Henson.
“AMC Visionaries: Eli Roth’s History of Horror” (Midnight., AMC): This seven-part documentary series brings together the masters of horror – the storytellers and stars who define the genre – to explore its biggest themes and reveal the inspirations and struggles behind its past and present. Each one-hour episode will take viewers on a chilling exploration of how horror has evolved through the eras and impacted society, as well as why loyal fans remain addicted to fear.

						Archbishop Mitty quarterback Shamir Bey, shown here against Menlo-Atherton, will lead the Monarchs into a WCAL opener Friday night against Serra at Foothill College.

PUBLISHED: September 20, 2018 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: September 21, 2018 at 12:33 pm


Friday

No. 1 De La Salle (5-0) at Buchanan-Clovis (4-0), 7 p.m.: De La Salle’s sixth and final non-league game takes the Spartans to the Fresno area for a showdown against the Central Section’s second-ranked team. Buchanan features two four-star prospects, junior running back Kendall Milton (offers from Alabama, Georgia and Florida State, among others) and senior wide receiver Jalen Cropper (offers from Utah, Arizona and Cal, among others). Levi Willems leads Buchanan in rushing with 371 yards and six touchdowns. Buchanan’s start includes wins over Paso Robles, Bullard-Fresno, Edison-Fresno and Liberty-Bakersfield. When De La Salle last visited Buchanan’s Veterans Memorial Stadium, in 2005 against Clovis West, it returned home with a 7-0 loss. — Darren Sabedra

No. 3 Antioch (5-0) at No. 12 Freedom (4-1), 7 p.m.: Antioch appears to have an edge in this Bay Valley Athletic League opener, given that it defeated California by 10 points one week before California beat Freedom by 15. But Freedom has controlled the matchup with Antioch through the years, winning 11 of the past 14 meetings dating to 2004. That includes a win over Antioch in the North Coast Section Division I semifinals last season. Willem Karnthong, Antioch’s senior quarterback, ran for 257 yards in the playoff loss. Freedom’s Giles Jackson, a Michigan commit, ran 260 yards and four touchdowns in 32 carries in the playoff victory. Karnthong and Jakcson will be back on the field Friday night. — Darren Sabedra

No. 7 Serra (1-2) vs. No. 15 Archbishop Mitty (2-1) at Foothill College, 7 p.m.: This has a Stanford-USC feel to it in terms of a Pac-12 opener that could determine a champion in a couple of months. Serra has a target on its back after claiming its first outright West Catholic Athletic League title in 48 years, not to mention a state trophy. Last year, Mitty couldn’t keep up in a pair of lopsided losses on the road — 64-21 in the regular season, 52-7 in the Central Coast Section playoffs. But the Monarchs are under new management with Sione Ta’ufo’ou at the helm as coach. This might come down to which quarterback — Serra’s Luke Bottari or Mitty’s Shamir Bey — makes fewer mistakes. — Vytas Mazeika

No. 24t Granada (4-0) at No. 13 California (3-1), 7 p.m.: This would have been a conference game in the past, but the East Bay Athletic League switched to five-team divisions this year, so Granada and Cal won’t count in the standings. It’s an intriguing contest. Granada might be under-rated. The Matadors have impressive wins over Manteca and Foothill in their last two games, and they are playing their first eight contests on the road because of work being done at their stadium. Granada’s home opener is Oct. 19 against Dougherty Valley. California was supposed to be a home game for the Mats. The Grizzlies might have preferred it that way. They are 2-0 away from home, including a 42-27 drubbing of No. 12 Freedom. Cal was up 42-19 until allowing a meaningless touchdown in the final minute, and it rankles the Grizzlies that they are behind Freedom in the rankings. Cal has solid skill players and a good line led by senior guard Adam Newman, who has an offer from the University of San Diego, according to 247sports.com. Cal Poly and Yale also are showing interest. In keeping with the under-rated theme, Granada’s Malini Ti’a should be attracting more attention than he has from the colleges. He’s listed as an athlete and is dangerous with the ball. — Mike Lefkow

Live Oak (3-0) at Pioneer (3-0), 7 p.m.: Both teams enter this Blossom Valley Athletic League Mt. Hamilton Division opener after great starts. This isn’t new for Live Oak, which went 4-0 to start the season in 2016. But Pioneer has not been undefeated after three games since 2009. Jonathan Singleton has been outstanding for Live Oak. The senior quarterback has completed 36 of his 60 passes for 424 yards, nine touchdowns and no interceptions. He has also rushed for a team-high 391 yards and two touchdowns. While the Acorns’ wins have been close this season (biggest margin of victory has been 12 points), Pioneer’s closest margin of victory has been 21 points (in its opener).  Pioneer has been balanced on offense, averaging 226 yards passing per game and 180 yards rushing. Defensively, Pioneer has allowed a total of 19 points. Both teams will be rested, since they had byes last week. — Phil Jensen

						Medical students and healthcare providers at Stanford Medical Center gathered Monday, Sept. 17, 2018, to demand that gun violence be treated as a public health crisis. They’re angry that there’s no federal funding for research into firearm safety. They also want medical schools to include firearm safety in curriculum. Rallies were held at 30 medical centers, including UCSF. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)

Doctors protesting gun

violence may spark shift

Re: “Doctors plan gun violence rally” (Page B1, Sept. 16):

Mercury News reporter Lisa M. Krieger is to be commended for a timely and important story on the efforts of health care professionals at Stanford Medical Center and 40 other leading medical centers across the country to heighten citizens’ awareness of the ongoing danger and repercussions of gun violence to be found in far too many communities.

What does it say when hundreds of our country’s most highly educated and respected health care professionals take the time and the effort to bring this problem to the forefront of our consciousness?

Across the Bay Area, residents took advantage of clear skies and mild temperatures to celebrate the Fourth of July with parades, barbecues and picnics outside.

Decked out in red, white, and blue, families lined the streets of San Jose’s Rose Garden neighborhood for the city’s 11th annual Fourth of July parade on Wednesday.

As children looked on and dogs adorned with patriotic kerchiefs lapped up attention and fallen treats, vintage cars and festive floats wound their way from Dana Avenue over to Naglee Avenue and along The Alameda.

“The best part is to look at all the neighborhood people,” said Ashu Sharma, 37, who lives near the parade route and wandered over mid-morning.

Crowds numbering at least 30,000 cheered as the Vietnamese Veterans of America Chapter 201 and the Bay Area Sikhs of America marched by along with a bevy of local politicians and clubs, around 2,000 participants in total.

Too often, people are trapped in their cars, running from place to place, Sharma said, but everyone comes together for the holiday.

Sarabjot Singh, a 16-year-old member of Boy Scout Troop 600, known as the Sikh Scouts, who marched in the parade, agrees.

“It’s great to see the different cultures meeting at the parade,” he said.

					
				

Officially known as the Rose, White and Blue Parade, the parade’s grand marshal this year was Tim Ritchie, the president of the Tech Museum of Innovation in a nod to this year’s theme, “Technology in the Valley.”

“Every year we try to pick a theme that really resembles our community and where we are and what’s going on around us,” said Bryan Franzen, the president of the parade.

And some of the latest technology to surface in San Jose was in fact on display, with a number of parade-goers using the electric scooters that have appeared around the city in recent months to zoom along the route and past road closures.

Hungry attendees munched on snacks from a lineup of food trucks that varied from Mexican to Korean cuisine. Judd Xavier bought his 6-year-old daughter, Laurea, a popsicle from an ice cream cart.

“It’s so family friendly,” Xavier said, gesturing around at the open street where kids were riding bicycles and families sprawled in the shade were unpacking picnic baskets.

Across the bay in Oakland’s Jack London Square, artisans, musicians and food vendors set up shop in the narrow Water Street promenade for the annual Fourth of July BBQ Block Party. Several hundred people packed the three-block stretch of music stages, a beer garden and a children’s playground.

Smoke filled the air as several restaurants cooked meat on open grills.

“The barbecue is so tender,” said Audrey James, 65, of Oakland, while holding a baby back rib in her hand. “It’s very nice to be here. You just walk around and see all these interesting things.”

James and her friend, Letha Osborne, 61, also of Oakland, are frequent visitors to Jack London Square’s dance events. Osborne said she bought some incense from a vendor “at a pretty reasonable price.”

As James and Osborne dined not far from Big Serg BBQ, an Oakland-based barbecue restaurant that set up shop in the middle of the promenade, animal rights protesters from the group Direct Action Everywhere walked past, chanting against the slaughter of animals for meat consumption and for the recognition of animal rights as they did last year. One protester was caged and another spilled fake blood on the pavement.

Sergio Oseguera, the owner and cook at Big Serg BBQ, said the protesters did not disturb his outdoor barbecue rack.

“Activists hope to denormalize violence to animals and to normalize the act of taking direct action to challenge violence,” according to a news release from the group. “Someday soon, they hope to see events at Jack London Square where no animals are harmed.”

Nearby, a beer garden featured breweries based in or near Jack London Square. Crooked City Cider, a newcomer, hopes to open a brick-and-mortar cider bar in the square in September.

Dana Bushouse, the owner and brewer of Crooked City Cider, said she is still nearly $30,000 short of her fundraising goal to start the cider bar.
But she hopes the holiday block party can help her reach her goal.

“I started out of my basement four years ago because I wanted to make ciders I wanted to drink,” Bushouse said. “When the masses come to Jack London Square, we want people to come to us.”

LAS VEGAS — The biggest problem the Sharks’ power play had against the Vegas Golden Knights had nothing to do with generating chances. 

The Sharks’ preseason ended with a thud Sunday as San Jose allowed three shorthanded goals, including two in an unsightly second period, in a 5-2 loss to the Golden Knights at a raucous T-Mobile Arena. 

 
The Sharks allowed two shorthanded goals to Tomas Nosek and another to Max Pacioretty to close the preseason with a 2-3-1 record. Their regular season opener is Wednesday at home against the Anaheim Ducks. 

Sharks defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic briefly exited Sunday’s preseason game in the second period, as he had to enter the quiet room — coach Pete DeBoer said — after it appeared he banged heads with a Vegas player. He returned to start the third period, though, as he was back alongside defense partner Erik Karlsson. 

Vlasic left the game at the 7:02 mark of the second, the time of the game when he took an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Vlasic went to the bench and retreated to the Sharks’ dressing room as Kevin Labanc served the penalty. 

The Sharks and Golden Knights were tied 1-1 at the time of Vlasic’s departure. Vegas scored three consecutive goals after Vlasic left to take a 4-1 lead by the end of the second period. 

Karlsson scored a power play goal for the Sharks at the 5:41 mark of the second period off an assist from Kevin Labanc. 

Labanc also scored on the power play with 3:32 left in the third period, with Vlasic and Tomas Hertl collecting the assists. 

The Sharks’ power play finished the game 2-for-6.

Former 49ers safety Eric Reid finally has found a new team, signing Thursday with the Carolina Panthers after lingering six months on the free-agent market. 

 
The 49ers, it turns out, wanted him, too. Amid injuries to starting safeties Jaquiski Tartt and Adrian Colbert, the 49ers pursued a one-year deal with Reid earlier this week, a league source confirmed. 


YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES?

Pick against our pros all season long and win!


*** 

Reid, as he waited for his next job, joined Colin Kaepernick in May by filing a grievance against the NFL over alleged collusion, claiming owners were keeping them out of the league based on their social activism and kneeling protests during the national anthem since 2016.

Reid had taken a visit in the spring to the Cincinnati Bengals, where it was reported they rebuffed signing him when he declined to state how he might act during the anthem. Kaepernick has not signed or even worked out for a team since opting in March 2017 to void his 49ers contract. 

					
				

Several players around the league responded to Reid’s signing with applause through social media, including Kaepernick, who tweeted: “Congrats 2 my brother @e_reid35, all pro safety who should have been signed the 1st day of free agency, who has signed a football contract. He was the 1ST person 2 kneel alongside me. Eric is a social justice warrior, continues to support his family. and communities in need.” 


Congrats 2 my brother @e_reid35, all pro safety who should have been signed the 1st day of free agency, who has signed a football contract.

Reid signed a one-year with the Panthers. Financial terms were not immediately known. The Panthers (2-1) are idle this week and next play Oct. 7 against the New York Giants. 

Reid, 26, played the previous five seasons with the 49ers and was their 2013 first-round draft pick. Coach Kyle Shanahan has said the team would have welcomed Reid back but didn’t think he was interested in playing a backup role at a minimum salary.

Meanwhile, the 49ers’ Tartt and Colbert are injured and did not practice Wednesday. Tartt landed a contract extension this spring as the 49ers committed to him rather than Reid. Colbert, a seventh-round draft pick last year, plays free safety, which is where Reid began his career and made the Pro Bowl as a rookie. 

Coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed earlier this season the 49ers did reach out to Reid, although no formal offer was made. 

“If any really good player wants to come in here on a minimum deal, and have a good player to be a backup, that’d be unbelievable,” Shanahan said then. “I don’t think that’s what Eric wants. I told you the reason we decided to go that direction is we made a tough decision but had to do it. We went with Tartt.” 

Former 49ers teammate Torrey Smith is now a wide receiver on the Carolina Panthers and he campaigned this week for them to sign Reid. 

“Eric Reid is a Pro-Bowl caliber safety, 26-years old with a first-round pedigree,” Smith told the Charlotte Observer. “And he’s one of the best men that I know. I know that teams obviously have to be interested in him, and honestly, with our injuries I hope he ends up here.

“I know how he is, his talent. If it’s something where (general manager Marty Hurney or coach Ron Rivera) come and talk to me about him, I’ll be glad to talk about him as a player and as a person. He’s one of the best men that I’ve been around. I hope that’s something that can happen for us, because I know with the injuries that we have he could help this team.” 

Hurney agreed, issuing this statement to the Panthers website: “Eric has been a starting safety in the NFL and has played at a high level througout his career. After we put safety Da’Norris Searcy on injured reserve, Ron and I discussed our options and Eric was at the top of our list. He is a physical safety with good ball skills and play-making ability.”

						Blues fans have three chances to catch the great Joe Louis Walker, who has gigs in Fremont, Santa Rosa and East Palo Alto Aug. 3-5.		
	
By Andrew Gilbert | Correspondent
PUBLISHED: July 31, 2018 at 11:00 am | UPDATED: July 31, 2018 at 11:04 am


Joe Louis Walker arrived on the blues scene half a century ago as a conspicuously old soul in a ridiculously young body.

As a teenage phenom on guitar and vocals he received sage advice from Jimi Hendrix and Willie Dixon. Before releasing his debut album in 1986 he’d recorded with pioneering blues legends B.B. King, James Cotton, Bo Diddley and Robert Lockwood Jr.

Now 68, the precocious young cat has embraced his role as a blues lion eager to pass on the hard-won wisdom he’s gleaned while standing on the shoulders of giants.

He’s performing around the region this week with a tight combo featuring Lenny Bradford on bass and vocals, Dorian Randolph on drums and vocals, and Bruce Bears on keyboards and vocals, hitting Fremont’s Smoking Pig on Aug. 3, the Sonoma County Fair on Aug. 4, and the East Palo Alto Blues Festival on Aug. 5.



It’s a chance for the San Francisco native to remind his formative stomping grounds that he’s an artist who’s always cast a wide musical net. Haunting the Fillmore Auditorium during the venue’s early years under the direction of Bill Graham, he caught the stylistically expansive programs pairing rising San Francisco rock bands with jazz greats, blues legends and British invaders.

“I grew up on gospel, soul, blues, rock, British blues and I love all of that,” he once said. “I’m a child of the ’60s, but I’m known for blues.”

His latest album, 2015’s “Everybody Wants a Piece” (Provogue) makes the case effectively, ranging from his cool crooning on Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh’s standard “Witchcraft” and the spiritual “Wade In the Water” to Buddy Guy’s “Man of Many Words” and Danny Kirwan’s early Fleetwood Mac blues-rocker “One Sunny Day.”



					
				

Details: 9 p.m. Friday Aug. 3 at Smoking Pig, Fremont; $20; 510-713-1854, www.smokingpigbbq.net; 5 p.m. Aug. 4 at Sonoma County Event Center, Santa Rosa; $15-$39; 707-545-4200, www.sonomacountyfair.com; Aug. 5 at Bell Street Park, East Palo Alto (event runs noon-5 p.m.); free; 650-799-8563, patrickbrockandcompany.com.

						Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during a press conference at U.N. headquarters, Wednesday, Sept. 26, 2018.		
	
By The Associated Press | 
PUBLISHED: September 30, 2018 at 8:19 pm | UPDATED: October 1, 2018 at 4:09 am


By ROB GILLIES and PAUL WISEMAN | The Associated Press

TORONTO — Canada was back in a revamped North American free trade deal with the United States and Mexico late Sunday after weeks of bitter, high-pressure negotiations that brushed up against a midnight deadline.

In a joint statement, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the agreement “will strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home.”

The new deal, reached just before a midnight deadline imposed by the U.S., will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. It replaces the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which President Donald Trump had called a job-killing disaster.

The agreement reached Sunday gives U.S. farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market. But it keeps a NAFTA dispute-resolution process that the U.S. wanted to jettison and offers Canada protection if Trump goes ahead with plans to impose tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts imported into the United States.

“It’s a good day for Canada,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said as he left his office. Trudeau said he would have more to say Monday.

“We celebrate a trilateral deal. The door closes on trade fragmentation in the region,” Jesus Seade, trade negotiator for Mexico’s incoming president, said via Twitter.

Representatives for the government of Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador have called a press conference to discuss details of the trade deal on Monday.

Canada, the United States’ No. 2 trading partner, was left out when the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement last month to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement.

					
				

The Trump administration officially notified Congress of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement on Aug. 31. That started a 90-day clock that would let outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto sign the new pact before he leaves office Dec. 1.

Trump threatened to go ahead with a revamped NAFTA — with or without Canada. It was unclear, however, whether Trump had authority from Congress to pursue a revamped NAFTA with only Mexico.

Some lawmakers immediately expressed relief that Canada had been reinstated in the regional trading bloc. “I am pleased that the Trump administration was able to strike a deal to modernize NAFTA with both Mexico and Canada,” said Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. “NAFTA is a proven success.”

NAFTA tore down most trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico, leading to a surge in trade between the three countries. But Trump and other critics said it encouraged manufacturers to move south of the border to take advantage of low-wage Mexican wages, costing American jobs.

Trump campaigned on a promise to rewrite NAFTA — or get rid of it. Talks on a rewrite began more than a year ago. To placate Trump, Mexico agreed in August to provisions that would require 40 percent to 45 percent of a car be built in countries where auto workers earn at least $16 an hour to qualify for NAFTA’s duty-free benefits.

It was surprising that the United States found it easier to cut a deal with Mexico than with Canada, a longtime ally with a high-wage economy similar to America’s. “When this got started, Canada was the teacher’s pet and Mexico was the problem child,” said Michael Camunez, president of Monarch Global Strategies and former U.S. Commerce Department official.

But relations between Ottawa and Washington soured. In the aftermath of a disastrous G-7 summit in Quebec in June, Trump called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest.”

The two countries need each other economically. Canada is by far the No. 1 destination for U.S. exports, and the U.S. market accounts for 75 percent of what Canada sells abroad.

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

MILPITAS — There would be no last-second heartache for Milpitas this time. Not with this team, not this season. In their toughest test to date, the Trojans took care of business Friday night, winning at home over Wilcox 42-17.

Tariq Bracy rushed for 213 yards and four touchdowns in 25 carries as he and his teammates gained measure of revenge after Bracy was tackled an inch from the goal line as time expired in a four-point loss at Wilcox last season.
“The whole team, we were very determined,” Bracy said after the Trojans ran their record to 7-0 overall, 3-0 in the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League’s De Anza Division. “Sour taste in our mouths last year. I give all the credit to my linemen. They made the wide open holes. I just ran through them.”

Wilcox had won its previous three games, including routs of San Benito and Los Gatos, and looked good on its opening series Friday as the Chargers ran 15 plays and took seven minutes off the clock.

But they didn’t score, and Bracy quickly made them pay.

A penalty wiped out the Milpitas star’s 68-yard run on the Trojans’ first offensive snap — one of two long touchdown runs by Bracy that were called back — but the senior did not let that slow him down.

On the next play, he dashed 52 yards on a screen pass, showing why he has college offers from the likes of Notre Dame, Cal, Washington State and Utah.

He eventually scored on a 4-yard run to give Milpitas a 7-0 lead.

					
				

“We played them last year, and he’s different,” Wilcox coach Paul Rosa said. “He’s big and strong. You can see why he has the offers that he has. He’s one of the better backs I’ve seen in a long time that we’ve played against, for sure. I can’t even think of a guy who I would say is better than him.”

Milpitas, ranked eighth by the Bay Area News Group, spent the first six weeks of this season rolling past over-matched opponents, outscoring its competition by a combined 253-20.

The game Friday figured to be closer, and for a half it was tighter than Milpitas probably wanted.

Rosa’s son, Paul Jr., kicked a 36-yard field goal early in the second quarter to make it 7-3 and then caught a 22-yard touchdown pass over the middle from David Hernandez to give the Chargers a 10-7 lead. A fumble recovery at the Milpitas 27 set up Rosa’s touchdown.

Bracy’s 13-yard run reclaimed the lead for Milpitas.

The Trojans then held Wilcox (3-3, 2-1) on fourth down near midfield with a minute left in the first half and scored again as TyRee Bracy — Tariq’s twin — tossed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Israel Gil to make it 21-10.

“We came in with the mindset to execute, and that’s what we came out and did,” said TyRee, who threw for 132 yards and also scored on a 1-yard sneak. “An overall team effort.”

Milpitas widened the lead to 28-10 early in the third quarter when Tariq Bracy raced into the end zone from 37 yards out.

Tariq scored Milpitas’ final touchdown on a 9-yard run.

“He’s an animal,” TyRee said. “I don’t know how else to explain it. Just an overall great athlete.”

Milpitas coach Kelly King echoed those comments, saying, “He’s a great player. Obviously he’s going to be playing on Saturdays and hopefully someday it will probably be Sundays.”

						Vice President Mike Pence’s speech amounted to a broad indictment of the methods and goals of what China insists is its peaceful rise to an economic great power. He said China is not being forthcoming about the real aims of its military expansion in the South China Sea and elsewhere and that it was cheating and effectively extorting U.S. firms while persecuting and subjugating Chinese people.

By David Nakamura and Anne Gearan | Washington Post

WASHINGTON – China “wants a different American president” and is working to undermine President Donald Trump and influence U.S. elections, Vice President Mike Pence asserted Thursday in a sharply critical speech that marked another escalation in rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.

Speaking at the conservative Hudson Institute, Pence accused China of using trade, diplomatic overtures and military expansion to spread its influence around the world and to work against U.S. interests. He called on American business leaders, academics and journalists to counter Beijing’s global campaign and vowed that Trump “will not back down” in the face of China’s challenge.



“President Trump’s leadership is working; China wants a different American president,” Pence said. “China is meddling in America’s democracy.”

The vice president’s remarks served as the latest salvo from the Trump administration amid a deepening trade war with China and new military hostilities. Top White House aides have said the administration is developing new policies to mark a turn in the bilateral relationship away from cooperation in many areas and toward outright competition.

At the same time, Trump has continued to press Beijing to support efforts to pressure North Korea into relinquishing its nuclear weapons.

This week, a Chinese warship conducted a dangerous maneuver and sailed within 45 yards of a U.S. Navy warship in the contested South China Sea, where China has sought to establish maritime dominance in the crucial shipping corridor.

“We will not be intimidated and we will not stand down,” Pence said, referring to the incident.

At a United Nations conference last week, Trump accused Beijing of trying to influence the election in retaliation for the escalating trade war in which both nations have enacted tariffs on more than $250 billion worth of goods. The president did not offer evidence of interference by Beijing, though administration officials told reporters that they viewed a number of Chinese actions as tantamount to interference.

					
				

Pence cast Beijing’s efforts as a highly coordinated, “whole-of-goverment approach to promote its interests around the world, including in the United States.

On the election interference issue, Pence cited an advertising supplement purchased by Chinese state media in the Des Moines Register in Iowa as an one example.

“The supplement, designed to look like news articles, cast our trade policies as reckless and harmful to Iowans,” he said.

Pence’s speech amounted to a broad indictment of the methods and goals of what China insists is its peaceful rise to an economic great power. He said China is not being forthcoming about the real aims of its military expansion in the South China Sea and elsewhere and that it was cheating and effectively extorting U.S. firms while persecuting and subjugating Chinese people.

“Beijing now requires many American businesses to hand over their trade secrets as the cost of doing business in China. It also coordinates and sponsors the acquisition of American firms to gain ownership of their creations,” Pence said. “Worst of all, Chinese security agencies have masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology – including cutting-edge military blueprints.”

The vice president called on Google to halt development on “Dragonfly,” a new search engine for the Chinese market which critics have said would allow information searches to more easily be tracked by the government.

The application “will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers,” Pence said.

He also accused China of using “debt diplomacy” to trap other countries into political cooperation through “questionable loans” to nation’s such as Sri Lanka and Venezuela.

Drawing applause while referring to Taiwan, Pence said that while the United States will continue to abide by the “One China” policy that recognizes Beijing’s authority, “America will always believe Taiwan’s embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people.”

In a wide-ranging interview on NPR on Thursday morning, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai suggested the Trump administration had not shown good faith in negotiating with Beijing over trade.

“The U.S. position keeps changing all the time, so we don’t know exactly what the U.S. would want as priorities,” he said. “And, number two, I think there’s been some attempt on the U.S. side to force something like the U.S. will get 100 percent and China will get zero. I don’t think this is fair.”

A new poll of data from 25 countries released this week from Pew Research Center found a widespread belief that China is a growing power, perhaps one that now rivals the United States in economic might, but that most people wanted the United States to retain its leading role in global affairs.

However, the poll also found very little confidence in the countries surveyed that the current American president would do the right thing in global affairs. Indeed, confidence in Trump was lower than for world leaders such as Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Russia’s Vladimir Putin – and even Chinese President Xi Jinping.

But Pence sought to put China on the defensive over human rights, citing the persecution of up to 1 million Uighurs, a Muslim minority group in the western part of the country, who have been detained in “reeducation” camps.

The vice president also criticized China for blocking U.S. media websites and making it more difficult for western journalists to secure visas, a move that Pence said came after the New York Times published critical stories about the wealth of Chinese leaders several years ago.

Although Trump and his aides have lashed out this week after the Times published a lengthy investigative report on the president’s personal wealth, Pence declared that it was “great to see more journalists reporting the truth without fear or favor” about Chinese aggression and abuses.

By JOSH REPLOGLE | The Associated Press
DETROIT  — The bishop who officiated Aretha Franklin’s funeral apologized Friday to Ariana Grande for how he touched her onstage and a joke he made about her name.
Bishop Charles H. Ellis III led Franklin’s funeral and awkwardly greeted Grande on stage after she performed “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.” Images of the moment showed Ellis’ hand holding Grande well above her waist, with his fingers pressing against one side of her chest.



The preacher apologized in an interview with The Associated Press at the cemetery where Franklin was interred late Friday.
“It would never be my intention to touch any woman’s breast. … I don’t know I guess I put my arm around her,” Ellis said. “Maybe I crossed the border, maybe I was too friendly or familiar but again, I apologize.”
He said he hugged all the performers during Friday’s eight-hour service.
“I hug all the female artists and the male artists,” Ellis said. “Everybody that was up, I shook their hands and hugged them. That’s what we are all about in the church. We are all about love.”
He added: “The last thing I want to do is to be a distraction to this day. This is all about Aretha Franklin.”
Many people posted close-up images of the moment on Twitter, tagging it #RespectAriana.
Ellis also apologized to Grande, her fans and Hispanic community for making a joke about seeing her name on the program and thinking it was a new item on the Taco Bell menu.

“I personally and sincerely apologize to Ariana and to her fans and to the whole Hispanic community,” Ellis said. “When you’re doing a program for nine hours you try to keep it lively, you try to insert some jokes here and there.”Ellis’ touching of Grande overshadowed some criticism earlier in the ceremony the short dress Grande wore for her performance. Numerous people posted criticisms online that the dress was too short for church.
Grande’s representative did not return an email message seeking comment Friday.

WATCH: San Francisco 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan on loss to Arizona Cardinals.





SANTA CLARA — Sunday’s game against the Arizona Cardinals could not have started any worse for the 49ers’ defense.

Already ahead by a touchdown, the 49ers did not get any type of pass rush on Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen, who was able to step up into the pocket and launch a 75-yard touchdown pass to an open Christian Kirk on Arizona’s first offensive play from scrimmage.

Beyond that, the 49ers’ defense did enough to at least help keep Sunday’s game at Levi’s Stadium competitive, allowing just 10 first downs and 220 net yards for the game in what ended up as a 28-18 loss to Arizona.

The two other touchdowns the 49ers’ defense allowed came on short fields, with the Cardinals going 18 yards on one scoring drive in the second quarter and 28 on the next in the fourth quarter.

“It’s frustrating. Obviously, the first play of the game on defense, we give up a big play,” said cornerback Richard Sherman. “We just have to be better than that. It was a simple play, it was easy to get stopped and we just didn’t execute it like we needed to.

“After that, they didn’t have much.”

					
				

The Cardinals’ offense, coming into Sunday, was ranked last in the NFL with an average of just 208.5 yards per game.

But after the 49ers allowed a combined 1,116 yards in their previous three games, perhaps they have something to build on for next Monday when they travel to face Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers.

“We found what the problem was on that play, and we moved on and shut it down,” 49ers defensive lineman DeForest Buckner said. “Guys continued to play the game we know we can play.

“It just shows a lot to the guys on the sideline, not pointing any fingers and figuring out the problem and solving it. ”

The 49ers held Rosen and the Cardinals offense to just 226 total yards, a vast improvement from the 406 yards they gave up to Kansas City on Sept. 23 and the 364 yards they allowed to the Los Angeles Chargers last week.

Cardinals running back David Johnson, who had 112 yards of total offense last week against Seattle, had 71 on Sunday.

Still, the two biggest problems the 49ers’ defense have had all year — a lack of sacks and a lack of takeaways — remain unsolved.

The 49ers lone sack of Rosen — by Cassius Marsh — came in the third quarter, giving them nine in five games. The 49ers also did not create a turnover, and now have just three takeaways in five games.

How do the 49ers create more turnovers?

“It’s rushing the passer,” Sherman said. “It’s anytime you take the ball from the quarterback. It’s just more strip attempts. It’s tighter coverage in the back-end, being where you’re supposed to be.

“Rushing and coverage have to work together. That’s the biggest thing.”

On the game’s opening play, Kirk got past cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon, who might have anticipated some safety help from Adrian Colbert as the 49ers’ secondary was in a cover-three. Instead, Colbert ran up the field toward Larry Fitzgerald, who was coming across the middle.

Kirk got behind everybody and caught the pass from Rosen in stride.

“It was just an undisciplined play by me,” Colbert said. “I saw Larry flash and it was just a bad play on my part. It’s something I have to correct.”
The only other completion of more than 15 yards the 49ers’ allowed was a 20-yard catch by Fitzgerald with 18 seconds left in the second quarter.

“If you take away the 75 yards, we played our best game in the secondary,” Colbert said. “That is how we have to be. Personally, I have to correct that mistake so it doesn’t happen again, so we can come out and be the defense that we are.”

						File photo: The move could calm corn and soybean farmers fretting about low commodity prices and Chinese tariffs on crop shipments. It also could help two Iowa Republicans locked in competitive races to keep their seats: Gov. Kim Reynolds and Rep. David Young.		
	
By Bloomberg News | 
October 4, 2018 at 11:48 am


By Jennifer A. Dlouhy and Mario Parker | Bloomberg News

President Donald Trump is poised to tell Iowa voters next week he’ll allow year-round sales of high-ethanol gasoline — a move that could bolster Midwest Republicans in tough election contests.

Trump is tentatively scheduled to commit to the policy change on E15 fuel that would expand the market for corn-based ethanol during a campaign event near Council Bluffs, Iowa, next Tuesday, according to people familiar with the planning who asked not to be named while negotiations are under way.



At the same time, the administration may announce reforms of the market for biofuel compliance credits that are traded by Wall Street banks as a financial commodity.

Administration officials are still working out details on the E15 move and seeking to ensure the announcement gets an enthusiastic response from biofuel producers, Midwestern politicians and corn farmers who have long clamored for the change, the people said. White House officials are seeking assurances that biofuel advocates won’t use the occasion to seek other policy changes.

Trump vowed to support ethanol while campaigning for president in Iowa and has hinted at plans to lift summertime fueling restrictions on gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol. But a formal commitment to unleash E15 is an important victory for Iowa, said Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa.

“If you look at where he’s making the announcement — in Iowa, the largest ethanol-producing state in the United States — it sends a very clear message that he is behind the American farmer, he is behind our renewable fuels and he is ready to make it happen,” Ernst said in an interview. “He’s fulfilling his promise, and I appreciate him for doing that.”

The move could calm corn and soybean farmers fretting about low commodity prices and Chinese tariffs on crop shipments. It also could help two Iowa Republicans locked in competitive races to keep their seats: Gov. Kim Reynolds and Rep. David Young. Both have pressed Trump on E15.

Trump’s announcement is set to come during a campaign event for Young, according to one person familiar with the plans. Later Tuesday, the president is scheduled to hold a rally at the Mid-America Center in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

					
				

White House representatives declined to comment.

The shift would effectively waive E15 from federal vapor-pressure requirements that block its sale from June 1 to Sept. 15 in areas where smog is a problem. At the same time, the Trump administration would pursue reforms in an opaque $2.5 billion market in biofuel compliance credits that are used by refiners to satisfy U.S. blending quotas.

Among the reforms being considered: position limits capping the number of so-called renewable identification numbers that can be held by traders, a shift that could push some of them out of the market.

Both year-round E15 sales and market reforms would require formal rulemaking by the Environmental Protection Agency, which could take another six months or more. Even then, there could be years of additional uncertainty, as foes in the oil industry sue over the E15 shift, which threatens to chip away at their share of America’s 143 billion gallon gasoline market.

That legal challenge could yet overturn the change in policy. Some EPA officials have warned they don’t believe the agency can waive E15 from vapor-pressure requirements without action from Congress, according to people familiar with deliberations over the issue.

Some ethanol advocates are pushing lawmakers to make the E15 change, a tacit recognition that congressional action might be more durable. On Thursday, the ethanol trade group Growth Energy unveiled a Washington-focused television ad highlighting Trump’s support for E15 and urging Congress to get behind it.

About 1,430 of the nation’s 122,000 filling stations sell E15 now. That’s just a sliver of the potential, according to ethanol advocates, who say station owners have been reluctant to offer E15 because of the cost of changing pumps.

Oil companies battling the change also warn about potential engine damage from motorists inadvertently pumping E15 into vehicles not approved to use it. The federal government has authorized E15 use in 2001 and newer light-duty passenger vehicles, but some automakers explicitly warn that car warranties would be voided if motorists use the fuel.

Some environmental activists argue expanding the availability of E15 will drive the production of more corn, resulting in more prairies being plowed and waterways polluted by agricultural runoff.

The issue boils down to a contest between ethanol and petroleum over market share, said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

It’s a “barroom brawl fight” between two of Trump’s key constituencies, Irwin said in an interview. Agricultural interests want more demand, he said, and petroleum proponents have to cut E15 off at the pass to prevent further market share erosion.
Bloomberg’s Justin Sink contributed.

	Watch: Truck tips over on curvy Northern California road

“Oh he’s in it, he’s in it to win it!” one contractor commentated as he captured video of a truck moments before it overturned on Highway 175.
Crews working for Caltrans District 1 on the roadway, between Hopland and Lakeport, paused to watch as the truck attempted to make it through a one-lane stretch near their construction site around midday Thursday. Within 10 seconds, the truck slips off the road and flips into shrubbery as a bystander is heard yelling “Ow!”


Caltrans posted the video to Facebook early Friday to remind viewers that vehicles over 39 feet in length are not allowed on the one-lane section of the road, where its contracted crew is building a retaining wall.
“Multiple signs are posted to warn truck drivers of this length restriction, but drivers continue to try to go through. Sometimes they simply get stuck, but others end up going over the embankment,” Caltrans wrote in its Facebook status. “This driver was not injured, but it must have been the ride of his life!”

						An investigation into a Mission District homicide last month has led to three suspects’ arrests, and the discovery that the weapon used was stolen from a police officer’s own car, San Francisco police said Wednesday, September 13, 2017

SAN FRANCISCO — An investigation into a Mission District homicide last month has led to the arrests of three suspects, and the discovery that the weapon used was stolen from a police officer’s own car, police said Wednesday.

Police said the department has begun an internal investigation into the personal handgun stolen on Aug. 12 from a San Francisco police officer’s personal vehicle.

Around 2 a.m. Aug. 15, officers responded to a report of a shooting at an apartment in the 3200 block of 26th Street, where they found Abel Enrique Esquivel Jr., 23, suffering from gunshot wounds. Officers soon found that Esquivel had been shot at 26th and South Van Ness Avenue.

Officers gave life-saving measures until firefighters arrived to take Esquivel to a hospital, but he died a day later from his injuries.

Homicide detectives’ investigations led them to identify two men — Erick Garcia Pineda, 18, and Jesus Perez-Araujo, 24, both of San Francisco. Both men were arrested Monday at 16th and Mission streets. Pineda was booked into San Francisco County Jail on suspicion of homicide, several counts of robbery, burglary, conspiracy and attempted murder and Perez-Araujo on suspicion of several counts of robbery, burglary, and conspiracy.

A third man, Daniel Cruz, 18, of San Francisco, was arrested and taken into custody just after 4 a.m. Tuesday  in the 2600 block of Mission Street. Cruz was booked into San Francisco County Jail on suspicion of homicide, robbery, conspiracy, and possession of stolen property charges.

Police said they believe the three carried out several Mission District robberies between Aug. 13 and Aug. 15, as well as an aggravated assault around the time of the fatal shooting.

This newspaper reported that at least 944 guns had been stolen from or lost by police in the Bay Area and state and federal officers across California since 2010. They included guns used to kill three people including Kate Steinle on a pier in San Francisco in 2015, artist Antonio Ramos in Oakland in 2015, and Jesus Orosco of Bay Point in Contra Costa County in 2014.

A gun stolen from now-retired Piedmont Police Chief John Hunt in 2012 was used in a San Francisco gang shooting a few months later. No one was hit as a suspect fired several shots along Mission Street.

					
				

Twelve guns were stolen from San Francisco officers and one weapon was lost, the investigation found. The lost weapon occurred in San Francisco, while the other guns were stolen from officers homes and cars across the Bay Area.

Last fall, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation requiring police store weapons in their private vehicles in locked containers not visible from the outside. Many of the guns stolen from officers were in backpacks and gym bags left visible inside unattended cars and trucks.

Anyone with information should about the Mission Distric homicide should call San Francisco police’s tip line at 415-575-4444 or text an anonymous tip to TIP411 beginning any message with SFPD.

Contact George Kelly at 408-859-5180. Contact Thomas Peele at 510-208-6458.

* The following commentary appeared in the Hotline newsletter on Monday (sign-up here) and has been updated and re-published here for readers who missed the original …

If Washington athletic director Jen Cohen isn’t the best value in the Pac-12, she’s on the top tier with … with … gimme a few days on that one.

In her two years on the job, Cohen has hired three Pac-12 Coach of the Year winners, including Mike Hopkins, and negotiated a $119 million deal with Adidas.

And now we find that Cohen isn’t merely the lowest-paid public school athletic director in the conference.

She’s also the lowest-paid public school AD in the Power Five based on department expenses.

This nugget comes via a report by Athletic Director U, whose authors reviewed the annual compensation packages of every athletic director in the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC.

They examined AD pay from a variety of angles, including compensation compared to department revenues and to department expenses.

The analysis makes one assumption — that the reports are true of a $900,000 annual deal for new Tennessee AD Phil Fulmer.

It goes on to conclude:

					
				

“The contract with the lowest annual guaranteed compensation relative to departmental expenses will be that of University of Washington Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen (0.48%).”

Cohen is expected to earn $520,000 in 2017-18, while Washington’s expenses for the year used in the survey (FY16) were about $110 million.

Below is the full list of Pac-12 public school AD pay for the current academic year, with UCLA’s Dan Guerrero on top.

(Guerrero was appointed in 2002 and will be the longest-serving AD in the conference, by far, when Utah’s Chris Hill retires this spring.)

As private schools, Stanford and USC are not required to provide contract terms.

Not listed but worth noting:

The average AD salary in the Big Ten, which the Pac-12 has long considered its closest peer, is $912,137, with four ADs earning seven figures annually (including Bill Moos, who jumped from Washington State to Nebraska last year.)

The average in the Pac-12 is $755,119, with only Guerrero at seven figures.

UCLA’s Dan Guerrero: $1,083,779

OSU’s Scott Barnes: $937,508

Oregon’s Rob Mullens: $814,891

ASU’s Ray Anderson: $800,000

Colorado’s Rick George: $772,418

Utah’s Chris Hill: $763,600

WSU’s Patrick Chun: $675,000

Cal’s Mike Williams: $609,000 (outgoing)

Arizona’s Dave Heeke: $575,000

Washington’s Jen Cohen: $520,000

Somebody, get Cohen a raise.

UPDATE: The Seattle Times reported Tuesday that UW president Ana Mari Cauce is planning to give Cohen a pay bump.

“There is no question (a raise is due), if you look at her salary compared to her peers,” Cauce told the Times after the Adidas deal was announced.

“She came in somewhat less tested, and that made sense. But I think it’s unquestionably time to look at a correction.”

The report added that Cohen’s new salary could approach $700,000 annually.

	Football: The King’s Academy aims to continue stellar play

		
	Dave Mendonca
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 19, 2018 at 10:00 am | UPDATED: September 19, 2018 at 11:11 am

					Monta Vista's Cheto Vasquez (12) combined for 352 yards and five touchdowns rushing and throwing against James Lick last Friday.
				

On paper, the match-up between a red-hot The King’s Academy football team and the winless Aragon Dons on Friday might not appear to have the makings of a competitive game.
But Knights coach Pete Lavorato doesn’t see it that way.
“Aragon is a very physical football team, and they are always very well-coached,” Lavorato said. “They have had a very difficult schedule so far and I don’t put much credence into records. It will be a tough competitive game, if we play well.”


The Knights, who have scored a total of 80 points in winning their last two games since dropping their season opener to Christian High of El Cajon, travel to San Mateo to take on the Dons Friday at 7:30 p.m.
Aragon, which finished second in the Peninsula Athletic League’s Bay Division last year en route to its seventh consecutive trip to the Central Coast Section playoffs, is off to its first 0-3 start since 2008.
The King’s Academy, which will be seeking to avenge a 38-24 loss to Aragon last year, is coming off of an impressive 43-6 triumph over the Homestead Mustangs last Friday behind another stellar rushing performance by senior running back Bralyn Lux.
For the third consecutive week, Lux topped the 100-yard mark, this time rambling for a career-best 202 yards and three touchdowns on just 13 carries.  He has already racked up 425 yards for the season, and is averaging 9.7 yards per carry.
“Lux is a great athlete, and his football I.Q. is off the charts,” said Lavorato. “He has speed, agility and toughness.”
Thanks to the domination of their offensive line of center Hunter Wright, tackles Matt Wilson and Chris Althausen, and guards David Mazzulla and Preston Auger, the Knights rolled up 337 yards on the ground. They attempted only two passes on the night.

 
Homestead, which fell to 0-4 on the season, escaped being shut out when Harold Rucker III scored on a short run in the third quarter.
Casey Latini was a bright spot in the loss for the Mustangs, toting the ball 18 times for a career-high 108 yards.
The Mustangs open their Santa Clara Valley Athletic League De Anza Division schedule Friday at Levi Stadium with a 7:30 p.m. encounter against the Los Gatos Wildcats (3-1).
The Fremont Firebirds, who slipped to 1-3 following a 42-7 loss to Santa Cruz last week, also begin their De Anza Division season Friday at home with a 7 p.m. contest against the 4-0 Wilcox Chargers.
A Bryand Arcia 40-yard strike to Michael Farantino accounted for Fremont’s lone touchdown in its loss to Santa Cruz.
“We beat ourselves with turnovers and a lack of discipline,” said Firebirds coach Adam Herald. “We have to get better.”
On Saturday, the Lynbrook Vikings, in quest of their first win since October of 2016, kick off their SCVAL El Camino Division season with a 1:30 p.m. battle at Los Altos against the host Eagles.
The Vikes fell to 0-4 on the season last week when they were beaten 41-6 by Pajaro Valley of Watsonville. Jay Lee scored Lynbrook’s only touchdown on a short run.
Cupertino and Monta Vista both have byes this week before beginning their respective El Camino seasons on Sept. 28, when the Pioneers will host Fremont and the Matadors will host Gunn.
Last week, Diego Zamora ran for four touchdowns and passed for a fifth to lead Cupertino to its third straight win with a 35-0 defeat of Prospect. Cheto Vasquez rushed for 184 yards and two touchdowns, and also passed for three scores, to spark Monta Vista to a 56-12 defeat of James Lick.
Defensive stalwarts Alex Law, Jonny Hernandez, Dom Stuart, Cevon Terry and Zach Apostolo helped Cupertino register its first shutout since blanking Gunn 48-0 in November of 2015.
At 3-1, Monta Vista is off to its best start since going 7-0 to begin the 2008 season. The 56 points it scored represented the most the Matadors have tallied in a game since beating Harker 56-0 on October 14, 2011.

REDWOOD CITY — A part-time babysitter has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing several young boys, authorities said.

Angel Gutierrez Monney 
The San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office said it launched an investigation on Sept. 4 after receiving a tip that 31-year-old Angel Leopoldo Gutierrez Monney, of Redwood City, was acting inappropriately with juveniles.

Gutierrez Monney was employed as a ride-share driver and a part-time babysitter through a childcare website, according to the sheriff’s office.

Through one family, Gutierrez Monney “was able to charm multiple other families and children who became his victims,” the sheriff’s office said in a news release Thursday.

Several boys under the age of 14 were identified as victims of sex crimes, according to the sheriff’s office. The alleged abuse occurred in private residences throughout the county.

Gutierrez Monney was booked into San Mateo County Jail on charges including lewd acts with a child under the age of 14 and contacting a minor with the intent to commit a felony.

The sheriff’s office said it has “serious concerns” there are other victims. Anyone who had contact with Gutierrez Monney can call Detective Jesse Myers at 650-363-4050 or Detective Joseph Fava at 650-363-4192.

	Kurtenbach: These A’s are just getting started

		
	Dieter Kurtenbach
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 4, 2018 at 2:25 pm | UPDATED: October 5, 2018 at 3:45 am

					OAKLAND, CA - SEPTEMBER 07:  Ramon Laureano #22 of the Oakland Athletics is congratulated by Matt Chapman #26 after hitting a lead-off home run against Yovani Gallardo #49 of the Texas Rangers in the first inning at Oakland Alameda Coliseum on September 7, 2018 in Oakland, California.  (Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)
				

The 2018 Oakland A’s were fun, engaging, endearing, and scrappy.
They were a team that demanded your attention and earned your admiration. They could go toe-to-toe with anyone in baseball and they were never out of a game until all 27 outs were made.
The A’s didn’t exemplify those truths that in their one-game playoff showdown with the Yankees on Wednesday — a game they lost 7-2 in the Bronx to end their season —but one game doesn’t nullify the results of the 162.


And here’s another truth for you: The 2018 Oakland A’s were a year ahead of schedule.
(Jane Tyska/Bay Area News Group) Nothing in baseball is ever certain, and any longtime fan can attest to the fact that expecting anything positive from the A’s organization is likely to only bring about disappointment, but this team should be in the thick of things in the years to come.
It was a minor baseball miracle that the 2018 A’s won 97 games — more than any team in the National League this season. Their success was incredible when you when you consider how young this team is. It’s incredible when you take into account how they started the season. It’s downright preposterous when you see how their starting rotation was decimated at a near-biblical level.
If the 2018 season was the baseline — and there’s plenty of reason to believe that it was — then the future is radiant in Oakland.
(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Now, there was some magic that helped the A’s get to 97 wins and the Wild Card Game this year. There were also a handful of downright awful teams in the American League that helped the playoff squads pad their win totals.
So don’t mark down the A’s for 97 wins or better going forward — use a pencil.
But playoff contention, perhaps even a division title? That’s absolutely possible — if not probable — for the A’s in 2019 and beyond.
And think about what the A’s had to overcome this year: this September, Oakland had to “bullpen” nine games because of the endless string of injuries to Major League caliber starting pitchers.
And while injuries seem to be an inevitability for pitchers these days — no one gets through an entire season with one five-man rotation anymore — the A’s might get more than a full rotation returning from injury next year: Jharel Cotton, Daniel Gossett, and Kendall Gravemen all had Tommy John surgery this year, Paul Blackburn and Andrew Triggs missed significant time with elbow and nerve issues, and ace Sean Manaea has shoulder surgery in September.
Add in another year of Mike Fiers, the possible re-signings of Edwin Jackson, Brett Anderson, and Trevor Cahill, further progression from Daniel Mengden and Frankie Montas, and two top-of-the-rotation prospects who are ready for the Big Leagues in Jesus Luzardo and A.J. Puk, and the A’s shouldn’t have to bullpen a game in 2019.
In fact, the A’s could have one of the rotations in baseball in 2019. And if luck evens out year-over-year, this team will have the deepest starting pitcher stable in baseball.
This, of course, leading into a strong bullpen, led by two of the best relievers in baseball, Lou Trivino and Blake Treinen.
Things look even better out in the field.
A.J. Puk<br />(Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) Aric Crabb/Bay Area News GroupContrary to late-season narratives around the excellent Khris Davis, third baseman Matt Chapman was the A’s MVP this year. Not only is he the best defensive third baseman since Adrian Beltre in his prime, but he was also one of the best hitters in baseball in the second half of the season.
Chapman starting spraying the ball to all fields over the final 64 games of the 2018 season, posting a gaudy slash line of .309/.371/.591 and a wRC+ of 162 (league average is 100).
Those are numbers that, extended over the course of a season — something Chapman said he believes he can do — would make Chapman a top contender for American League MVP, regardless of his defense. (For reference, MVP candidates Alex Bregman and Jose Ramirez posted a slash line of .286/.394/.532 and .272/.388/.555 respectively for the Astros and Indians this year.)
Of course, the defense is the start of the conversation with Chapman. The third baseman saved 29 runs on defense this season — far and away the top mark in baseball. If Chapman, alone, was a team, he would have finished ninth in all baseball in defensive runs saved — the best metric for defensive prowess.
Chapman is a superstar — the kind of player that can singlehandedly turn around a franchise. I think we saw that this season, but he can get so much better in the years to come.

But the burden of a team’s campaign isn’t entirely on Chapman’s shoulders moving forward. No, no no — far from it. If Davis leads the American League in home runs again next year — and what reason is there to believe that he won’t?— the A’s will have two MVP candidates, three Gold Glove candidates (Chapman, first baseman Matt Olson, and outfielder Ramon Laureano), and one of the strongest lineups in baseball.
And as exciting as the A’s young pitchers are, their position prospects are even more tantalizing — Franklin Barreto, Jorge Mateo, Dustin Fowler, and Sean Murphy are all poised to make an impact in Oakland in 2019.
Murphy should be of particular interest — the A’s haven’t gotten much production from the catcher position the past few years, but the soon-to-be 24-year-old, who ranks No. 47 on MLB.com’s league-wide Top 100 prospects list, posted a .856 OPS in Double-A last year and should push for a job at the big league level in 2019. Even if the bat isn’t there at the start of his major league tenure, his defense — he has a plus arm that keeps baserunners at bay — should immediately translate. This might be the guy the A’s have been waiting for since Terry Steinbach. (No offense to Kurt Suzuki.)

Ultimately, the A’s problem in 2019 might legitimately be that they have too much talent for their 25-man roster — there are going to be some tough decisions to make in free agency and Spring Training — and better yet, almost all of it is cost-effective and under team control.
Looking around the league, it’s hard to see a better on-the-diamond situation going forward. The A’s are good now and poised to get better in the years to come.
Of course, that’s only the half of it.
So my sincere hope is this: the 2018 season created enough inspiration for the A’s organization and enough political goodwill for the city of Oakland that the organization breaks ground on a new ballpark in the next year.
Because without a new ballpark, all of this talent could go to waste — or, more accurately, to other teams because of financial restraints. It’s unfortunate, but that’s Oakland A’s baseball.
But hopefully, this season started a new era — because these A’s are just getting started, and it’d be great to see this team get a long, sustained shot at doing something special.

One franchise already dominates its sport, the other feels it has the pieces to get back on top very soon. Dieter Kurtenbach welcomes Jacob Palmer of the San Francisco Examiner to take a look at what the offseason in the NFC West has meant to the 49ers, and ask why Golden State is so confident they can handle the Houston Rockets in the playoffs?

By BEATRICE CHRISTOFARO, Associated Press

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A Stanford mathematician is among four men who on Wednesday were awarded this year’s Fields Medal, a prestigious award that many describe as the Nobel Prize of mathematics.

Given every four years to up to four recipients, the prize goes to mathematicians under 40. The winners were announced during the International Congress of Mathematicians being held in Rio de Janeiro.

Akshay Venkatesh, 36, has been at Stanford since 2008, and for the past year has been on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

A press release from Stanford says Venkatesh, from Perth, Australia, graduated from high school at 13 and went on to the University of Western Australia, where he became the youngest student ever to graduate with first-class honors in pure math. He earned a doctorate from Princeton.

His work has been in number theory, where the breadth of his expertise has drawn acclaim. “Most number theorists tend to work on one side or the other because each aspect is already quite big and it’s very difficult to assimilate the tools from all the different areas,” said his Stanford colleague Brian Conrad in the university press release.

The release went on: “One substantial area of Venkatesh’s work has been finding more ways in which homogenous dynamics can be used in number theory. For example, he describes a ball bouncing inside a triangle when the ball doesn’t slow down. His math asks questions about what spaces the ball avoids or prefers and how this changes if the triangle’s sides are curved. He then uses those ideas to solve problems in number theory.”

The other three winners were:

	Peter Scholze, 30, of the University of Bonn, Germany.
	Caucher Birkar, 39, of the University of Cambridge, England.
	Alessio Figalli, 34, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.


Upsetting the celebration, someone stole Birkar’s 14-karat gold medal after the awards ceremony. Organizers said they were cooperating with authorities to retrieve the prize.

					
				

This was the first time the congress has been held in Latin America.

						Milpitas celebrates its victory over Southwest El Centro in the Division 4-A state title game Saturday night in El Centro.		
	
By Tom Ronco, Correspondent | 
PUBLISHED: December 17, 2017 at 12:41 am | UPDATED: December 17, 2017 at 2:41 pm


EL CENTRO – Its lead gone but championship hopes still alive, Milpitas did not leave the Southern end of the state empty handed.

More than 500 miles from the Bay Area, the Trojans drove 54 yards late in the fourth quarter Saturday night to post a come-from-behind 45-41 win over Southwest-El Centro in the CIF Division 4-A state championship game.

It was the first state football crown in the school’s history.

“We played a great team and they came back hard on us but in the end we made the plays,” Milpitas coach Kelly King said.

The game started slowly for the Trojans as Southwest deferred and kicked off to the visitors.

Milpitas drove but ultimately punted, and Tyler Saikhon caught a 69-yard pass for a touchdown and 7-0 lead.

The Trojans answered on their next play from scrimmage with a 70 yard touchdown run by Tariq Bracy.

Southwest went back on top 14-7, but Bracy scored again to make it 14-14.

Senior kicker Mariano Robles then hit a 20-yard field goal and Milpitas was ahead 17-14. It was the first of three field goals byb Robles, who also connected from 27 and 37 yards.

					
				

“I knew I was going to play a big part in this game,” Robles said. “I came into the game thinking that if it came down to making a kick to win I could do it.”

Milpitas then took a 24-14 lead into halftime as Tyree Bracy found brother Tariq on a 35-yard pass play.

With Tariq Bracy rushing for 161 first-half yards on 12 carries and with the Milpitas defense having held Southwest’s Saikhon to just four yards, things looked good for the Trojans.

Things looked even better for the Trojans when senior defensive captain Gabriel Erickson intercepted a pass that Robles converted into three points and a 27-14 lead.

“I watched film and so I keyed on the fullback and saw him creeping out and the linemen moving forward and I figured screen and made a play on the ball,” Erickson said.

And it looked even better when the Trojans forced an Eagle punt that Tariq Bracy returned 57 yards for a touchdown.

Leading 34-14 just minutes into the third quarter, Milpitas looked primed to put the game away.

That’s when Southwest’s Derrek Guzman split the seam of the Trojans secondary for a touchdown, then Southwest scored again when Milpitas fumbled a hand off. The ball popped out of the air and a Southwest defender raced 79 yards to score.

In less than two minutes Milpitas’ 20 point lead had been cut to six points.

“I thought we were taking the game … we’ve done that this season,” Erickson said. “Then we blew a couple of coverages and they made plays.”

Robles’ third field goal on the first play of the fourth quarter put Milpitas up 37-28, but Southwest came back to cut the lead to 37-35.

The Trojans were forced to punt on their next possession and Saikhon scored from 49 yards out on a pass play with 3:42 to play. Suddenly, Milpitas trailed 41-37.

“The way they battled back down by 20, that’s the way this team is,” said Southwest coach Tom Mitosinka. “They came back on heart. They are a resilient group of kids and I’m proud of them and their coaches.”

Milpitas’ Noah Rodriguez made a strong kickoff return to the Trojan 46-yard line and Tyree Bracy then found Tuni Fifta on a 39-yard touchdown pass. Tariq Bracy’s two-point conversion run gave Milpitas a four-point lead.

“This is an amazing feeling,” Tariq Bracy said after the game. “This team came together when we had too. We dealt with adversity, but that’s what good teams do.”

It had to be an amazing feeling for the 22 Milpitas seniors after having lost five straight CIF section championship or state regional games until last week’s victory in the regional semi-finals.
Difference-maker Robles, who joined the team last season, understood the importance of the victory.

“I know the story of these guys who have played together for four years,” Robles said. “To help them win it was very special.”

By The Associated Press | 
PUBLISHED: February 24, 2018 at 5:07 pm | UPDATED: February 24, 2018 at 5:11 pm




LAS VEGAS (AP) — A 21-year-old man was critically injured when he fell from an escalator at Las Vegas’ Neonopolis, police say.

The man, whose name has not been released, fell from the second floor when he tried to slide down a rail of the escalator shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday.

Police say that witness reports and video indicate the man was intoxicated. He was among a group of friends visiting the Neonopolis, a shopping and entertainment complex at the Fremont Street Experience.

The man was taken to University Medical Center in critical condition, police Lt. Trish Cervantes told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

“As for prevention,” she added, “people should use the amenities provided as they are intended to be used.”

	Google drops out of Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud competition

		
	Bloomberg News
	  
	October 8, 2018 at 8:23 pm

	  
		Categories:
		Business, Latest Headlines	



	(Bloomberg) — Alphabet Inc.’s Google has decided not to compete for the Pentagon’s cloud-computing contract valued at as much as $10 billion, saying the project may conflict with its corporate values.
The project, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud, or JEDI, involves transitioning massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. Companies are due to submit bids for the contract, which could last as long as 10 years, on October 12th.

Google’s announcement on Monday came just months after the company decided not to renew its contract with a Pentagon artificial intelligence program, after extensive protests from employees of the internet giant about working with the military. The company then released a set of principles designed to evaluate what kind of artificial intelligence projects it would pursue.


“We are not bidding on the JEDI contract because first, we couldn’t be assured that it would align with our AI Principles,” a Google spokesman said in a statement. “And second, we determined that there were portions of the contract that were out of scope with our current government certifications.”
The spokesman added that Google is “working to support the U.S. government with our cloud in many ways.”
Google is behind other technology companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in obtaining government cloud-security authorizations that depend on the sensitivity of data a service is hosting.
The JEDI contract attracted widespread interest from technology companies struggling to catch up with Amazon in the burgeoning federal government market for cloud services. Final requirements for the project were released in July after a months-long lobbying campaign in Washington by tech companies including Microsoft, International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. that opposed the Pentagon’s plans to choose just one winner for the project instead of splitting the contract among a number of providers.
“Had the JEDI contract been open to multiple vendors, we would have submitted a compelling solution for portions of it,” the Google spokesman said. “Google Cloud believes that a multi-cloud approach is in the best interest of government agencies, because it allows them to choose the right cloud for the right workload.”
In a report to Congress, the Defense Department said making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that “could prevent DoD from rapidly delivering new capabilities and improved effectiveness to the warfighter that enterprise-level cloud computing can enable.”

	UC Berkeley employee arrested in notorious NorCal Rapist cases using genetic genealogy website

		
	Matthias Gafni, Rick Hurd and Thomas Peele
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 21, 2018 at 9:22 am | UPDATED: September 24, 2018 at 5:19 pm

	SACRAMENTO — Just months after the breakthrough in the Golden State Killer cold case, police have used DNA and genealogical technology to nab another suspected serial rapist, believed to have terrorized women in six counties starting in the 1990s.
Authorities say UC Berkeley employee Roy Charles Waller, 58, of Benicia, the so-called NorCal Rapist, is responsible for at least 10 and possibly more attacks on women from Martinez to Sacramento, including one in which he posed as a trick-or-treater on Halloween night in 1996.



Waller was arrested without incident Thursday near his work place in Berkeley, identified by the same genealogy database that put suspected Golden State Killer Joseph DeAngelo behind bars earlier this year.
In 2006, investigators in the NorCal Rapist case were able to link 10 attacks to the same individual through matching DNA. After learning how DeAngelo was caught, the investigators created a special profile that could be submitted to GEDmatch. Investigators uploaded to information to the website 10 days ago, and the case was cracked days later, Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said at a news conference Friday. GEDmatch allows users to voluntarily upload their DNA profiles onto the massive database, allowing users to find a lost relative — or, lately, helping police officers to track down long-sought killers and rapists.
“Genealogy 10 days ago led us very quickly to this individual,” Schubert said. “It was probably record-setting how quickly Mr. Waller was identified as the person we were looking for.”
According to court records obtained by the Sacramento Bee, once Waller was identified through the genealogy website, investigators collected two samples of his DNA from his trash can outside his house and linked the DNA from a straw to two 2006 attacks. Those records also indicate that the GEDmatch led to a “close relative of the NorCal Rapist” and that law enforcement narrowed him down using his physical appearance, previous addresses and his ownership of similar guns used in the crimes.
Investigators said it’s possible there are other victims out there, but Schubert said Waller is not suspected of committing any attacks on the Berkeley campus.
Waller has worked at UC Berkeley since 1992. He is a safety specialist in the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, training employees how to safely operate forklifts, aerial lifts and respirators, said university spokesman Dan Mogulof. The office is located at University Hall, a building that houses the School of Public Health just across Oxford Street from the university’s main entrance. The office was closed Friday afternoon with a handwritten sign on the door referring those with questions about Waller to campus spokespeople.
“We were shocked today to learn that a campus employee was arrested in connection with a series of rapes,” Mogulof said in a statement. Campus police “will be reviewing any open sexual assault cases to determine if any might be related,” he said.
The NorCal Rapist’s string of sexual assaults occurred between 1991 and 2006 and included the Halloween night attack in Martinez in 1996 and an assault in February 1992 in Vallejo.
Waller has been charged with 12 counts of forcible sexual assault related to attacks on two women in Sacramento on Oct. 14, 2006. Those charges carry special enhancements of using a gun that would carry a lifetime prison sentence and have no statute of limitations. He is being held in a Sacramento County jail without bail and is scheduled to be arraigned Monday at 1:30 p.m.
Former Contra Costa crime lab chief Paul Holes, who helped crack the Golden State Killer case, said he spent decades working on the NorCal Rapist case, too.
He recalled the horrific details of the Martinez assault. The victim was resting on her couch Halloween night when she heard the doorbell and she answered, thinking it was a late-arriving trick-or-treater.
The suspect, wearing a skeleton mask, tackled her, handcuffed her and carried her upstairs where he repeatedly raped her for hours. Holes said the suspect was “very evidence conscious,” cleaning and destroying various items. Police believe he phoned the victim at her dental office about two weeks after the attack and apologized.
Holes initially tied the Martinez rape to the Vallejo assault through DNA evidence. And when police obtained blood DNA from a 1997 rape in Chico where the victim stabbed the attacker with scissors, it was a match, Holes said.
“We knew then we had a serial rapist,” he said.
In 2006, Contra Costa prosecutors filed a John Doe complaint with a specific DNA profile of the NorCal Rapist, and a $500,000 arrest warrant was issued with that information, even though they didn’t yet know the identity, District Attorney Diana Becton said.
Sacramento police Detective Avis Beery described the suspect’s typical methods in carrying out the rapes.
He would enter houses late at night when the women were often asleep. He would overcome them, bind them and repeatedly sexually assault them, Beery said. He would ransack the houses, sometimes stealing items. Other times, he would kidnap the women and take them to an ATM where he would force them to withdraw money that he would steal, Beery said.
“The suspect was a real life boogeyman,” Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig said.
Four victims have been reported in Yolo County — a Woodland woman in 1996, two women in Davis in 1997, and another woman in Davis in 2000, authorities said. The first-known victim, in Rohnert Park, spoke to NBC Bay Area on Friday afternoon.
“I finally see a face and have a name, and you imagine all these years who this person is and how did they know you and where did they come from,” said the woman. “I don’t think it’s hit me quite yet. It will.”
Public records show Waller had previous addresses in Richmond, El Sobrante, El Cerrito, San Pablo, and Rodeo in Contra Costa County; Nice and Lakeport in Lake County; and Sacramento.
Nobody answered the door Friday at Waller’s two-story beige home in a middle-class neighborhood in Benicia, according to the Sacramento Bee. Neighbors said Waller mostly kept to himself and would often work on his cars and water his tomato plants.
Students at Cal said they were notified in a campus-wide email Friday.
Sophomore Stephanie Gutierrez said it was “really, really scary “ to learn a long-term university employee is accused of being a serial rapist. She said Cal should put “all the resources it needs” to make sure Waller isn’t involved in any unsolved campus assaults.
The arrest comes nearly five months after authorities caught up to the Golden State Killer, a serial killer who raped more than 50 women across the state.
After that arrest revealed the groundbreaking genetic genealogy techniques, Holes was invited to speak about the process to Sacramento law enforcement.
“The NorCal Rapist was brought up as the No. 1 priority at the time,” Holes said.
Genetic genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter, who helped crack the Golden State Killer case, trained some of the Sacramento District Attorney investigators who pieced together family trees in the NorCal Rapist case.
She said if the public wants to see more cases solved, they should consider uploading their own genetic information to GEDmatch or those types of websites.
“Increasing the number of people in the database will not only help catch criminals but also will help in identifying the thousands of unidentified victims of violent crimes,” Rae-Venter said. “It is especially important for folks from minority groups to test as they are woefully under-represented in GEDmatch.”

						Epidemic of robocalls: Why your mobile phone is under siege and what you can do about it		
	
By Tracey Kaplan | tkaplan@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: July 8, 2018 at 9:00 am | UPDATED: July 10, 2018 at 5:25 am


Kristie Karkanen cringes whenever a call comes in from an unfamiliar number. Which con artist or telemarketer will it be this time — a phony IRS agent demanding payment for back taxes, someone babbling threats in Mandarin or a guy offering a “free’’ resort vacation?

It’s no wonder the Fremont resident is leery of picking up the phone. In May alone, swindlers and legitimate businesses bombarded Americans with a record 130 million intrusive automated messages — per day — according to YouMail, a robocall blocking service that collects and analyzes data. That’s 12.5 calls per person per month, though many people put up with far more unwanted calls.

“It’s gotten to the point where I don’t answer the phone anymore,’’ Karkanen said, adding that the barrage has made her wary even of legitimate callers. When the FBI phoned her back last year after she reported alleged government fraud, “I didn’t believe it was them.’’

The explosion in robocalls is driven by technological advances that allow anyone using an Internet-powered phone system to make virtually untraceable calls from anywhere in the world for a penny or less apiece.

In one case, a single operation based in a Miami apartment with links to a Mexican call center was able to reach nearly 97 million people during a three-month period ending in 2016 before the federal government shut it down and fined the owner a record $120 million. On top of defrauding people by claiming to represent major companies such as TripAdvisor and Marriott, the operation disrupted a medical-paging service’s emergency communications by inundating it with calls.

It is illegal under federal law to use automated telephone dialing systems and/or pre-recorded messages for sales calls without written or electronic consent from recipients — regardless of whether there is a scam involved. (Some pre-recorded informational messages, including appointment reminders, flight cancellations and charitable solicitations are legal; political calls without prior consent are legal only to landlines.)

In an effort to combat the flood of robocalls, government agencies have sued and won judgments totaling more than $1.5 billion since the Do Not Call Registry was established 15 years ago, held technology contests to spur the development of call-blocking apps, and made it easier for members of the public to file lawsuits, including class-action litigation.

But robocallers are playing a game of cat and mouse that no agency so far has been able to slow down. About 4.5 million complaints poured in to authorities last year, nearly a third more than the year before, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the Do Not Call Registry.

And consumer advocates fear the situation may soon get worse, depending on how the Federal Communications Commission reacts in the coming months to a recent court ruling striking down  Obama-era regulations intended to curb the calls. The most significant issue is what qualifies as a computerized auto-dialing device.

If the FCC sides with the calling industry by defining auto-dialers so narrowly that the ban doesn’t apply to many devices being used today, “the consequence will be a tsunami of unwanted and unstoppable calls to our cell phones,’’ said Margot Saunders, chief counsel for the Boston-based National Consumer Law Center, one of the leaders of a coalition of more than 40 consumer and legal aid groups that support tough robocall regulations. “We’re very afraid of what this commission will do.’’

San Jose network engineer Daniel Safradin said he is already interrupted day and night by robocalls — even when he and his wife are “being intimate.’’

Worse yet is when he forgets to turn off the sound on his phone before going to bed and is awakened in the middle of the night by a disembodied voice peddling “deals’’ like a “free’’ cruise.

“My blood just boils,’’ said Safradin, who even got a call from an unrecognizable number that he dared not answer while our photographer was there to take his picture.

Toni Whyte, a digital marketer who works out of her home in Livermore, used to pick up calls that looked local before learning that many robocallers use fake caller ID to trick people into answering. Now, she lets most calls ring into voicemail, but greatly resents the time it takes to check those messages, about five a day from robocallers.

To add insult to injury, even letting it ring to voicemail can backfire. Your message can confirm the line is active — and can be sold as a “lead’’ to another robocaller.

“I keep blocking the calls and of course they keep popping up again using a different number,’’ Whyte said. “It’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole.’’

Robocalls are so ubiquitous that my editor couldn’t get through reading this story without getting a call from a robotic fake IRS agent threatening: “If I don’t hear a call from you, we will have to issue an arrest warrant under your name and get you arrested.”

A high percentage are scams. In May, they made up 43 percent of the 246 million calls made by the top 20 robocallers, according to YouMail.

Most of the other calls came from debt collectors. About a third of American consumers have accounts in collection, according to the Urban Institute.

In hopes of avoiding robocalls of all kinds, nearly 230 million consumers currently list their landline and cell phone numbers on the Do Not Call Registry. The list was intended to stop legal marketers — originally on landlines and now also on cell phones — but has had limited success in reducing the flood of robocalls, for two primary reasons.

It turns out that the registry offers no protection if you have consented to being contacted by particular companies. Many of us do so unwittingly by checking a notification box or agreeing to a business’ terms and conditions without reading the fine print.

Consumers can block those robocalls by calling the companies and revoking permission, though it doesn’t always work. The FCC plans to take a second look at its consent-revocation procedures when it takes up the auto-dialer issue.

Another reason the Do Not Call Registry hasn’t been able to stem the tide of robocalls is that scam artists operate entirely outside the rule of law.

They boldly prey on the elderly and other vulnerable groups like immigrants and small businesses by impersonating a variety of agencies, from the IRS to student-loan collectors. In the latest shakedown, immigrants in New York city reported being swindled out of millions of dollars by Mandarin-speaking scammers pretending to be from the Chinese consulate and demanding money to protect victims’ U.S. legal status.

Closer to home, the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office just issued a warning to Bay Area residents, urging them to ignore calls from hucksters who claim to represent prosecutors and demand an immediate cash payment on a payday loan. The DA’s office never makes such demands, prosecutor Teresa Drenick said.

Altogether Americans lost an estimated $9.5 billion to such phone scams last year, according to one study.

Will Butler, a trash hauler in the Southern California community of Hacienda Heights, said he was bamboozled recently into giving up his Social Security number after hearing a robocall spiel and then pressing 1 to talk to a live person, who accused him of reneging on a high-interest payday loan.

“I was trying to prove my innocence, to show it wasn’t me,’’ he said. “I didn’t realize they could steal my identity.’’

Some federal lawmakers are trying to slow the flow. Sponsored by Bay Area Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Palo Alto), the Help Americans Never Get Unwanted Phone Calls bill, or HANGUP Act, aims to protect students, homeowners, veterans and farmers with federal loans from unwanted robocalls and texts by requiring government contractors to obtain consent first.

The Repeated Objectionable Bothering of Consumers on Phones bill, or ROBOCOP Act, co-sponsored by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), would require phone companies to provide customers with new free tools to block robocalls.

But even though most Americans regardless of their political affiliation are perturbed by the calls, the legislation is expected to face an uphill battle getting through Congress. Some of the new laws would stiffen the penalties on violators, including big banks that rely on automated calls to collect debts and wield clout in Washington.

The U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform is already angry that the FCC has made it easier and more lucrative to sue businesses while scammers often go unchecked. Large settlements include Capital One, which agreed in 2015 to pay $75 million after plaintiffs alleged that it and three collection companies made robocalls to collect debts, and JP Morgan Chase in 2016 for $34 million, regarding updates or debt collection. Consumer groups counter that without those suits, the robocall problem would be even worse.

Turning to technology may be the best solution — including for consumers with a taste for revenge. As is stands now, most call-blocking apps intercept numbers that appear on blacklists, sending them to voicemail or preventing them from getting through unless the caller enters a certain number, which the auto-dialers can’t do, according to Consumer Reports’ latest list of ways to stop the bothersome calls. Many robocallers evade the screening by constantly switching fake caller IDs; to address that, the telecom industry is working on a call-verification system that would assign a certificate of authentication to every telephone.

For payback, there are a couple of options. The call-blocking service called Robokiller uses robots of its own to answer the calls. The winner of the FTC’s 2015 contest, “Robocalls: Humanity Strikes Back,’’ the app answers the robocall and presses 1 to get through to a human operator. Then it plays a  pre-recorded message created either by the company or its customers to waste the operator’s time. The results are often hilarious, including a gag “answer bot’’ that strings the operator along by asking for her honest opinion about his off-key singing voice and ends with him saying he has to go gargle some eggs.


Some people would rather do it themselves. San Jose lawyer Angela Storey dealt handily with a robocall once she reached an operator, who told her that federal marshals were on their way to her house because of an IRS debt that could put her in federal prison for two years.

“I told him I would meet them outside, and did I need to bring my own toothbrush,’’ Storey said. “He seemed confused, so I told him that two years in a federal minimum security prison sounded like a vacation compared to the screaming, fighting kids in the background. Then he called me a few choice names and hung up.’’



WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT ROBOCALLS

Report them to the feds: Share the callers’ numbers with the Federal Communication Commission — (888) 225-5322, Ext. 4 — and/or the Federal Trade Commission. Although robocalls often get through even if you’ve listed your number on the Do Not Call Registry, the FTC still encourages people to file complaints about violators. The agency makes the numbers available on a daily basis to telemarketers and call-blocking apps, and they are also used to assess the scope of the robocall problem, identify trends and aid in investigations.

Share information online about annoying calls and suspected scams: Sites such as https://800notes.com/ allow you to share warnings with others; we reported an IRS scam call from 916-545-7185, for instance, and found nine other people also complained. The reports may help carriers and call-blocking apps screen calls.

Should you answer a robocall or let it ring to voicemail? Some say never answer; others insist your voicemail message confirms the line is active and may be sold as a lead. There’s a consensus on the value of blocking unwanted calls, including call-blocking devices, mobile apps, cloud-based services, and services provided by your phone carrier.

	Olympics: Marcus Fraser leads a day of firsts for Olympic golf

	RIO DE JANEIRO — On a day of firsts for Olympic golf, Marcus Fraser of Australia had the one that mattered — the first-round lead. 
Fraser ran off four straight birdies before the wind arrived and kept right on going until he had an 8-under 63, giving him a three-shot lead over British Open champion Henrik Stenson of Sweden and Graham DeLaet of Canada. 
Better yet? He set an Olympic record Thursday, though that was hardly a surprise considering golf had not been part of the Olympics since 1904. 


“That’s pretty cool,” Fraser said. “So hopefully, that lasts all week.” 
There was plenty for golf to celebrate in its return to the Olympics, from the opening tee shot by Adilson da Silva of Brazil to the first hole-in-one by Justin Rose, who wasn’t even sure his 7-iron from 189 yards on the fourth hole had gone in the cup until he heard the crowd. 
And yes, it was quite the crowd. 
No one was quite sure what to expect from the gallery on the first day, in a country with very little golf heritage and with no medals awarded until Sunday. Padraig Harrington was surprised to see more than 6,000 spread out across Olympic Golf Course. 
It all started with da Silva, the only Brazilian in the 60-man field, so nervous over that opening shot that “my head was everywhere,” he said. His drive went straight down the middle, and golf was on its way. 
“The end of a long journey,” said Peter Dawson, president of the International Golf Federation. “Or the beginning of a new one.” 
DeLaet, who has struggled with the yips in his short game so badly that he took six weeks off this summer, was in the first group to honor George Lyon, the Canadian who last won a gold medal in golf at the St. Louis Games. 
“It’s been a while since we’ve won a gold,” DeLaet cracked when he finished. 
Also in that opening threesome was former Cal golfer and U.S. Amateur winner Byeong Hun An. He’s tied for ninth after his 68 as the early starters played in calmer conditions.
The biggest surprise came from the Americans. 
Rickie Fowler said earlier in the week that with four Americans in the field — no other country has more than two — they could sweep the podium. After one round, Matt Kuchar at 69 was the only American to break par. 
Fowler had a 30-foot birdie putt on the opening hole, and four putts later he walked off with a double bogey. It didn’t get much better from there. Fowler shot a 75, beating only two players — Rodolfo Cazaubon of Mexico and Lin Wen-Tang of Taiwan. 
Bubba Watson couldn’t buy a putt and started his back nine with a tee shot into a native area with sand thick enough to host beach volleyball. That led to a double bogey and he wound up at 73. Patrick Reed made three bogeys in a four-hole stretch after making the turn and shot 72. 
“Horrendous,” Reed said. 
Harrington, who shot 69, was one of four players chosen to present golf’s case to the International Olympic Committee when it was voted back into the games in 2009. 
“I said it to the guys walking off, ‘Now we are Olympians,’ and nobody can take that away from us,” he said.

						Kanye West performs during the Season 44 premiere of “Saturday Night Live.”		
	
By Chuck Barney | cbarney@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
October 2, 2018 at 9:54 am


Kanye West’s rambling pro-Trump speech may not have made it on the air during last weekend’s edition of “Saturday Night Live,” but the cast of the sketch-comedy show were held “hostage” and had to uncomfortably endure it, according to Kenan Thompson.

Appearing on “Late Night With Seth Meyers,” Thompson filled the audience in on what went down at the end of the Season 44 premiere of “SNL.”

“He voiced his opinion very loudly for a long time,” said Thompson, a longtime “SNL” star. “We’re all entitled to our own opinion — I don’t know if that’s the moment, necessarily to hold people hostage like that …”

Thompson said he wasn’t onstage for West’s rant — but several of his fellow cast members were.

“As soon as he said ‘Hey, join me up onstage everybody!’ I was like ‘Oh, there goes the little cheese in the mousetrap! It’s going down!’” he says. “I felt so bad for those guys, because it’s hard to stand there and not be able to debate somebody who’s going so far against your personal opinion as well, and just stand there and take it.”

Thompson called West’s appearance on Saturday’s show a “circus,” adding that occasionally happens with musical guests.

“If they’re a little bit crazy . . . we let them have that,” he said.

The long-tumultuous relationship between Stanford and Santa Clara County is facing new growing pains, as the esteemed university seeks permission, again, to expand.

Stanford aims to add about 40 football fields worth of academic buildings and enough beds to fill 17 Four Seasons hotels over the next two decades — construction it says is essential to keep its world-class stature as an engine of innovation.

But some neighbors and local officials fear worse traffic headaches and housing problems, adding that the university failed to meet the terms of a previous approval: declaring when all the growth will end.

“How big can they get? Will they someday stop?” asked Tina Peak, of Palo Alto, at a meeting last month at Palo Alto City Hall. “Or will they just come back every 15 years to build more millions of square feet?”

Stanford’s ultimate size — its so-called “maximum planned buildout potential,” an estimate that was required but never delivered in 2000 when it last petitioned the county to expand — “is information that would be important to have,” said county Supervisor Joe Simitian, who represents the region. Back then, after much debate, the county authorized construction of 2 million square feet and 3,000 housing units, the equivalent of three Stanford Shopping Centers.

Stanford says it is not reasonable to predict future growth beyond the year 2035, and that previous county leadership agreed.  A 15- to 20-year time horizon is standard practice for cities and counties, said Stanford’s Jean McCown, associate vice president of Government and Community Relations.

“The idea that it could be for a very long time or even ‘forever,’ as compared to the accepted planning horizons of 15, 20 and 25 years, does not make sense,” said McCown. Stanford’s future growth scenario is consistent with the current growth rate, she said.

“The Farm” has become an innovation machine, turning the once-sleepy Peninsula into an economic juggernaut. With half of its 8,100 acres in Santa Clara County, Stanford’s campus is the size of a small city and includes a major shopping center, research park, homes, schools and recreational facilities, in addition to open space. But it is exempt from paying most property taxes.

By the end of this next phase of development, Stanford will have more than tripled its 1960 size, from 4 million to more than 14 million square feet — in addition to housing.

					
				

There’s one month left for community members to comment on a draft Environmental Impact Report, part of a so-called General Use Permit — essentially, Stanford’s permission slip from Santa Clara County to continue developing its property between 2018 and 2035.

The county rated four issues as “significant” in its report: construction noise, conservation of historic buildings, increased congestion on freeways and increased traffic in intersections.

Traffic would be most affected, it said, along already-congested routes: intersections along Foothill Expressway; the Page Mill Road “off-ramp” from southbound Interstate 280; and the intersection of Alma Street and Charleston Road.

After Dec. 4, the county’s report will be finalized and supervisors will vote on Stanford’s application.

Stanford’s plan envisions 2.3 million square feet of new academic buildings and up to 3,150 new housing units. There’s a strong focus on expanding postdoctoral research facilities, which could spur the creation of new Silicon Valley tech companies.

Another 9,000 students, faculty and staff would be added to the campus. Currently, Stanford holds about 30,100 people.

The plan keeps development out of Stanford’s foothills and open spaces like The Arboretum, an issue that has been contentious on the Peninsula. Also, there is no new construction planned for the San Juan area of campus, a subdivision of elegant and historic faculty homes.

Instead, the university will develop its central campus more densely.

To accommodate this growth without adding traffic, Stanford plans to develop new transit programs. The university has achieved the “no net commute trips” terms of its 2000 permit, offering transit incentives, bike programs, bus fleets, steep parking fees and other programs. There’s been a decline in the number of people driving solo to Stanford.

New housing means that more students can live on campus, rather than adding to commute stress, Stanford says.

“I know 2 million square feet and 3,000 housing units can feel like a lot of development, but Stanford has a unique opportunity to address this in a successful way,” said Catherine Palter, Stanford’s associate vice president for land use and environmental planning.

Neighbors were relieved that the new plan doesn’t intrude into the serene foothills, and some welcomed the role that the university plays in the valley.

“I believe that Stanford has been a good neighbor, consistently responsible in dealing with the community around it,” said Hal Mickelson, a Palo Alto resident and retired Hewlett-Packard attorney.

Others were skeptical.

Residents are already bracing for more congestion as the university finishes major expansions of its two hospitals. With a new building due to open in December, the campus of Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital will grow to 844,000 total square feet, more than double its current size. The new 824,000-square-foot Stanford Hospital, to open in 2019, will increase patient capacity to 600 beds, enlarge a Level-1 trauma center and offer an emergency department nearly three times the size of its current footprint.

“The hospitals haven’t even opened yet … and the quality of life is becoming extreme from transportation and housing problems,” said Alice Smith, of Palo Alto.

Meanwhile, the city of Palo Alto is struggling with its own congestion problems, with more jobs than available homes. The companies that lease space at Stanford Research Park are more densely packed with employees than in the past, residents said. They also worried about pending development in south Palo Alto, on the Fry’s Electronics site.

“Stanford is a great institution,” said Arthur Keller, a former member of Palo Alto’s Planning and Transportation Commission.  “However, too much of a great thing is not good.”

The 10 best uses of color in film, according to CineFix. Governments are beginning to track loneliness, which is bad for our health. Little Free Libraries come in different shapes, including the shape of Pizza Huts. And are there mountains, churches and other places named after you or your loved ones? To find out, search the Geographic Names Information System database.

Highlights
The renovation at Presentation High School is anticipated to be completed in multiple phases, with the first phase spanning only a year and involving the demolition of several buildings and construction of seven new structures.


Presentation High School has announced plans for a major overhaul of its campus, a project expected to get underway in 2020.

The renovation is to take place in multiple phases, with the first one spanning a year and involving the demolition of several buildings and construction of seven new structures and additional parking areas.

The first phase would focus on facilities deemed the most inadequate yet with the highest student use, according to school principal Mary Miller. Those are the cafeteria, event space and library.

When completed, the first phase will feature a renovated cafeteria, student lounge, library and tech center, study center, classrooms, meeting space for student projects, weight room and workout facility, enlarged dance studio, large multi-purpose space for events and meetings, and practice space.

Among the buildings the school is considering knocking down altogether are the student center, chapel and two classrooms.

While the school is eyeing 2020 as the start of construction, “the timing is not set in stone because it relies on a number of variables,” Miller said. Further phases are only conceptually planned at this point, she added.

According to Miller, aging buildings necessitated the remodeling effort, as the original structures are nearly 60 years old. What’s more, Miller noted that “the needs of students and schools have changed over time.”

An added bonus, Miller said, is that by expanding its facilities, the school will create space for an additional 100 students, which would bring the student body to 850 girls. Presentation is an all-girls private Catholic school.

A master plan for this project accounts for a modest enrollment growth equaling fewer than 30 girls, Miller said. That plan also addresses parking, traffic and safety issues and indicates that measures will be taken to reduce construction impacts.

					
				

Discussions about the renovation began in earnest in mid-2017 when Presentation started working with an architect to develop a long-term master site plan. As part of that effort, the school had applied to rezone an 8.79-acre site on its property from single-family residence to public/quasi-public.

The last building project at Presentation occurred almost four years ago.

In terms of outreach, Miller said the school has conducted three neighborhood meetings and plans one more for the near future, to be hosted by the city of San Jose.

By John Wagner | Washington Post

WASHINGTON – First lady Melania Trump said in an interview broadcast Thursday that there have been people in her husband’s White House whom she doesn’t trust, including some who still work there, and that she considers herself one of the most bullied people in the world.

During the interview with ABC News, conducted during her recent solo trip to Africa, Trump was asked by interviewer Tom Llamas whether the president has had people working for him she didn’t trust.



“Yes,” she replied, adding that she has let her husband know.

“Some people, they don’t work there anymore,” the first lady said.

Asked whether there are still people in the administration she cannot trust, Trump said yes.

“It’s harder to govern,” the first lady said. “You always need to watch your back.”

Her comments come in the wake of an anonymous op-ed in The New York Times last month claiming that there is a “resistance” within the Trump administration. The Times said the piece was written by a senior administration official, whose identity has not become public.

					
				

Asked about his wife’s assertions during an interview Thursday on Fox News Channel, President Donald Trump blamed being a newcomer to Washington for some of his picks and said he is happier with his team now.

“Are there some I’m not in love with? Yes, and we’ll weed them out,” he added.

During the ABC interview, Llamas asked Melania Trump whether she has the most control over her husband’s decisions of those in the White House.

“Oh, I wish,” she said, laughing.

“I give him my honest advice and honest opinions, and then he does what he wants to do,” Trump said.

During the interview, Trump also discussed her child-welfare initiative, Be Best, which includes a focus on combating cyberbullying.

“I could say I’m the most bullied person on the world,” she said.

Pressed on that assertion, she added: “One of them, if you really see what people are saying about me.”

“That’s why my Be Best initiative focuses on social media and online behavior,” Trump added. “We need to educate the children of social, emotional behavior, so when they grow up and they know how to deal with those issues.”

Asked for examples of the first lady being bullied, spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham pointed to comments her boss has received in response to Twitter posts.

Since her arrival at the White House, Trump’s appearance and clothing choices have been heavily scrutinized and her accent has been the source of jokes, including by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Her Be Best initiative also has been the target of heavy online criticism.

							Mat Hayward)/Mark Morris Dance Group

						Members of the Mark Morris Dance Group perform the Baetles-inspired “Pepperland,” which comes to UC Berkeley Sept. 28-30.		
	
By Andrew Gilbert | Correspondent
PUBLISHED: September 25, 2018 at 10:00 am | UPDATED: September 25, 2018 at 10:10 am


When choreographer Mark Morris was asked f he’d be interested in participating in the city of Liverpool’s celebration marking the golden anniversary of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” he thought it was a terrible idea.

“I’m not that big on the Beatles in general,” he says. “I had to decide very quickly. I listened to the music, which I knew but hadn’t heard in years, and I was interested enough to go on.”

But before Morris agreed to participate in the celebration, which was initially conceived as a revue with different artists commissioned to create a piece for each song, he laid down a few guidelines. For starters, he had no interest in working with the original 1967 recordings.

“I’m not going memory lane or doing nostalgia. Nothing is more disgusting to me. I only work with live music, and I immediately of course contacted Ethan Iverson,” he says, referring to the pianist/composer who was at the time in the process of leaving The Bad Plus, the popular jazz trio known for poker-face interpretations of rock, pop and disco anthems that work as both unblinking tribute and winking mockery.

With a creative team in place, the Mark Morris Dance Group went about transmuting the iconic album into “Pepperland,” a signature Morris production that earned an ecstatic response in Liverpool in its May 2017 premiere. Co-commissioned by Cal Performances, “Pepperland” kicks off UC Berkeley’s 2018–19 dance season Sept. 28-30 in Zellerbach Hall.



The Bay Area premiere of the evening-length work is the centerpiece of the Mark Morris Dance Group’s campus residency, which that includes a community dance class (12:30 Sept. 28), an artist talk with Morris and Iverson (2 p.m. Sept. 28), and a Morris-curated film series at Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (Sept. 28-Nov. 30). “Mark Morris Presents: In the Age of Pepperland” features seven films, and the avid cinephile will be on hand introduce several, including Michelangelo Antonioni’s “Blow-Up” (7 p.m. Sept. 28) and Mel Brooks’ “The Producers” (7 p.m. Sept. 30) . And whatever his ambivalence about the Fab Four, he also picked Richard Lester’s Beatlemania-mocking classic “A Hard Day’s Night.”

“It was an unbelievably productive and fertile decade for cinema,” says Morris, who presented a similar BAMPFA series in conjunction with the 2016 Cal Performances world premiere of “Layla and Majnun.”

“They’re the greatest movies of the period,” he continues. “I could do a year-long movie festival. ‘Blow Up’ is a very surprising movie that couldn’t be made today. I showed it to students at Dartmouth and their reactions were ‘I hate the way the women were treated.’ ‘Everybody’s smoking cigarettes.’”

					
				

While Morris’s attitude toward the Beatles is less than reverential, he bristles at descriptions of his work as irreverent. “To me irreverent seems unserious, like this is a lark,” he says. “Of course I did enormous amounts of research. Everything is there, including things that aren’t there. The song that everybody knows is not sung. There are no lyrics, no vocals. But people know the lyrics. It’s a shadow idea that I’m not presenting directly.”

Freed from treating the album as canonical, Morris and Iverson created a score that weaves together Iverson’s originals with about half the songs from “Sgt. Pepper” radically reimagined, including the title track, “With a Little Help From My Friends,” “A Day in the Life,” “When I’m Sixty-Four,” “Within You Without You,” and “Penny Lane” (a song recorded during the “Sgt. Pepper” sessions but released later on “Magical Mystery Tour”).



Iverson assembled a highly unusual seven-piece “Pepperland” ensemble with Rob Schwimmer on Theremin, Colin Fowler on organ, harpsichord, and keyboard, Sam Newsome on soprano saxophone, percussionist Vinnie Sperrazza, vocalist Clinton Curtis, and trombonist Jacob Garchik (who’s become an essential Kronos Quartet collaborator as a stylistically omnivorous arranger).

“If I hadn’t worked with Mark before I wouldn’t have known what to do,” says Iverson, who spent many years as the Mark Morris Dance Group’s rehearsal pianist. “I’ve seen a lot of his evening-length works, and he’s masterful at these suites or oratorios. There’s nothing worse than a Beatles covers project. How do you do something fresh? You have to be disrespectful. Don’t cower. That’s where The Bad Plus experience comes in, taking pop music and doing something new with it.”

Even with all his experience and insight into Morris’s sensibility, Iverson didn’t find the right tone or tempo right off the bat. In keeping with his Bad Plus methodology, his first draft tended toward the portentous and gloomy.

“Deconstructing pop music you slow it down, make it more chaotic,” says Iverson, who also celebrates the release of a new duo album with tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, “Temporary Kings” (ECM) at Kuumbwa on Oct. 11. “Mark said, you’ve gotta give us more pep. I went back to the drawing board and made sure to keep it moving. I wouldn’t have wanted to do this if I didn’t believe in Mark so much. The cornball potential is so huge. I knew Mark could do this. I thought, I can do this, too.”

					Rick McKee, The Augusta Chronicle, GA
				

The confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh continues Wednesday. On Tuesday, the hearings “launched as a bitter political brawl, with loud objections from Democratic senators, the arrests of dozens of protesters and questions even from some Republicans about how Kavanaugh would separate himself from President Trump, the man who chose him,” according to The Washington Post.

						Wide receiver Dante Pettis #18 of the San Francisco 49ers is taken down and injured on the play by outside linebacker Jatavis Brown #57 and defensive back Adrian Phillips #31 of the Los Angeles Chargers at StubHub Center on Sept. 30, 2018 in Carson, California.

CARSON — Left tackle Joe Staley walked out of the 49ers locker room with a brace on his injured right knee and a glum look on his face, casting concern over the 12th-year veteran’s status.

Staley declined comment and 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said he did not yet know the severity of Staley’s injury following Sunday’s 29-27 loss to the Chargers.

Right tackle Mike McGlinchey also sustained a first-half knee injury, and when the 49ers opened the second half, they had backup tackles protecting C.J. Beathard, their would-be backup who made his first start this season in place of the injured Jimmy Garoppolo.

Wide receiver Kendrick Bourne #84 of the San Francisco 49ers celebrates after a touchdown in the first quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers at StubHub Center on Sept. 30, 2018 in Carson, California. 
Staley got hurt in the second quarter when Beathard was driven into his knee by a hit from blitzing safety Derwin James. After the 49ers’ final snap before halftime, McGlinchey limped off the field with his own knee injury, and it forced this year’s top 49ers draft pick to miss a series until he returned.

“Losing our both tackles for a while there was scary,” Shanahan said. “I was real happy McGlinchey toughed it out there. His obviously wasn’t as bad as Staley’s, but I knew it was hard for him to go that second half.”

Garry Gilliam replaced Staley, while Erik Magnuson filled in for McGlinchey. Center Weston Richburg sustained a knee injury on the first snap but returned after missing only one play, drawing admiration from Shanahan.

PETTIS’ PAIN: Rookie Dante Pettis, the 49ers’ second-round pick, was the first to get hurt Sunday, also with a knee injury. His happened two minutes into the game while getting tackled on a punt return for minus-3 yards.

MRI exams on Pettis, Staley and McGlinchey likely will be done Monday to determine damage.

					
				

Complicating matters among the receiving corps Sunday, Marquise Goodwin’s hamstring injury kept him off the field at times, and because both he and Pettis play the “X” position at split end, the 49ers needed Kendrick Bourne and Trent Taylor to fill in there. Bourne responded with a 2-yard touchdown catch to give the 49ers a 14-0 lead.

BREIDA STATUS: Running back Matt Breida said he was not 100 percent as he played through a knee injury, and he also had to overcome a shoulder stinger Sunday. He had a 20-yard reception to start the 49ers final series, and he finished with only nine carries for 39 yards.

LONG DRIVE: A 21-play drive ate 10:24 off clock as the 49ers settled for a 21-yard, Robbie Gould field goal to take a 17-6 lead. The last NFL team to have a 21-play drive was the 2015 Cleveland Browns, and it was the 49ers’ most time-consuming drive since 2002 (10:44, 20 plays at St. Louis)

PICK SIX: Antone Exum staked the 49ers to a 7-0 lead with his 32-yard interception return for a touchdown three snaps into the game. It was the 49ers’ first interception this season, and it came with Exum making his second straight start in place of the injured Jaquiski Tartt. Rivers’ 3rd-and-10 pass floated over the head of Keenan Allen and Exum caught it on the fly, raced untouched to the end zone and fired the ball into stands heavily filled with 49ers fans.

“It was a really good call by our coach,” Exum said. “He saw Rivers looking that way, and just by the grace of God, I was in the right place at the right time.”

Elsewhere in the secondary, the 49ers did not suit up Richard Sherman (left calf) for the first time this season, and Ahkello Witherspoon eventually got benched in favor of Greg Mabin. At free safety, D.J. Reed made his first career start while Adrian Colbert (hip) was restricted to special-teams duty.

JIMMY G UPDATE: C.J. Beathard said Jimmy Garoppolo was “really positive” last week in meetings and helping the 49ers prepare to play without him since his season-ending knee injury. “He was really supportive and great,” Beathard said. Garoppolo is expected to have reconstructive knee surgery later this month.

GORDON’S DAY: Linebacker Reuben Foster swapped jerseys with the one he chased most of the day, that belonging to Melvin Gordon, who signed it: “Keep working bro. Stay great!” Gordon broke several tackles on the day as he ran for 104 yards on 15 carries, plus seven receptions for 55 yards and a TD. “In the first half he was kind of stumbling, but he did great at the end of the day,” Foster said.

James Franco once lost his temper and physically assaulted Busy Philipps while filming a scene for “Freaks and Geeks,” the actress has written in her new book “This Will Only Hurt a Little.”

Philipps, 39, said that the scene called for her to hit Franco on the chest while delivering the line “Dammit, Daniel, do something.” But she said Franco broke character after she struck him, grabbed both her arms and screamed, “Don’t ever touch me again!”

He then threw her to the ground and knocked the wind out of her, Phillips writes in the book, a copy of which was obtained by Page Six.

She said Franco was an “(expletive) bully” on the set of the show, which ran on NBC during the 1999-2000 season.

Philipps said writer Judd Apatow called her later that night and told her that he and show creator Paul Feig would tell Franco to apologize to her. But Philipps said Franco received “barely a slap on the wrist” for his actions.

“James was full of bad behavior, so why would this be treated any differently,” Philipps wrote. She added that a “boys’ club” mentality existed on the set, and there was no point in telling Apatow and Feig about how Franco made her feel uncomfortable during the filming of the show.

Philipps had spoken previously of the accident. In a 2011 reunion of the “Freaks and Geeks” cast, she and her co-stars discussed and laughed about the incident, according to Page Six. Franco was not present at the reunion.

She opened up about it again during a 2016 interview on “Watch What Happens Live.”

“We’re friends now and we really like each other now as adults, but as kids we did not get along,” she said.

In the book, Philipps said that after the incident, she told everyone on the set that she was fine although she had tears in her eyes. After shooting the scene a second time, Philipps said she ran to co-star Linda Cardellini’s trailer and told her what happened. Cardellini advised that Philipps tell her manager.
Last year, Franco, 40, won a Golden Globe best actor award for “The Disaster Artist,” but fell out of favor during Oscar nominations after a number of women came forward with allegations of sexually inappropriate, exploitative behavior from the Palo Alto-born actor, writer and director.

PUBLISHED: April 27, 2016 at 6:58 pm | UPDATED: September 23, 2016 at 1:45 am


SAN JOSE — The last Facebook post by the teen is easy to dismiss as typical teen angst.

“(Expletive) yeah to the kids who feel like they’re dying inside but still gather up the strength to roll out of bed, get dressed and leave the house. You are strong and beautiful and worth so much more than you know.”

But after he and his brother were arrested Wednesday in the slaying of their parents, trace bits like this from their social-media profiles and narrow glimpses offered by friends and relatives begin to form a sketch that hints at tension not readily apparent to many who knew the family.

Much is still unknown about the deaths of 59-year-old Golam Rabbi and 57-year-old Shamima Rabbi, who were found dead from gunshots wounds Sunday at their hillside Evergreen home. The discovery was made by relatives who hadn’t heard from the couple for days.

A motive remains unclear; as does when they were killed. Still, there was enough evidence for San Jose police to arrest their sons, a lightning bolt that pierced what was already an inconsolable cloud of mourning.

“We are very shocked,” said Golam Mustakim, a nephew of the Rabbis who credits them with helping his family settle in the United States. “Emotionally, I’m broken right now.”

Hasib Bin Golamrabbi, the couple’s 22-year-old son and a San Jose State student who hadn’t been seen since the killings, was arrested in Tracy. His 17-year-old brother, an Evergreen Valley High School senior whose name is being withheld because he is a minor, was arrested in San Jose after initially being interviewed and released by police.

The case took on a national profile after it was revealed that next to the bodies, someone had scrawled a stomach-turning message: “Sorry my first kill was clumsy.”

Another cryptic message was written on a wall at the crime scene — “I can’t be like you telling a lie … I can’t love someone without telling them.” 

					
				

Who wrote those messages remains a mystery; San Jose police have revealed few details about the case.

Scant clues remain as to why the brothers are suspects. Some of the teen brother’s schoolmates described him as pessimistic, but not extraordinarily so. There was a sense of surprise among peers that the 17-year-old was still attending school in the wake of his parents’ death; he was on campus Wednesday, hours before he was arrested.

“You would think he wouldn’t be able to function or go to school at all,” one student said. 

The older brother, Golamrabbi, exhibits an aspirational air on social media, celebrating in one instance his admission to San Jose State, posting a photo of a dream house and hinting at a romantic crush.

A cousin who did not want to be named out of privacy concerns said she didn’t know of anything that would have caused a conflict between the brothers and their parents.

“The younger brother was quiet. He didn’t speak to anyone much. He had difficulty with social interactions,” she said. “The older one was more social.”

Hasan Rahim, who worshipped with the Rabbis at the Evergreen Islamic Center and knew them for more than 20 years, said nothing appeared to be amiss on the occasions he interacted with the brothers.

“This is the first time really when I came to know that things were not as placid as I thought,” he said. “I never saw any sign of trouble.”

Golam Rabbi was a hunter and owned at least one firearm, Rahim said. He recalled cautioning his friend, ‘Hey you better be careful.’ He laughed and said ‘Oh yeah, I am very careful,’ ” Rahim said. 

The younger brother was interviewed by detectives Sunday and released. As recently as Tuesday, he was not identified as a suspect, as detectives sought to locate and question the older Golamrabbi, who also was not formally declared a suspect at the time. Police have not disclosed what led them to identify the sons as their parents’ alleged killers.

Golamrabbi is tentatively scheduled for arraignment Friday afternoon. He is being held without bail in the Santa Clara County Jail while his brother is being held at Juvenile Hall.

Golamrabbi declined a jailhouse interview with this newspaper; court records show he has no adult criminal record in the county.

Golamrabbi hid in an unidentified friend’s closet in Tracy for 24 hours and confessed to shooting his father, according to KPIX 5, which interviewed the friend. The friend said he was scared and helped Golamrabbi, and called police after he left.

The Rabbis were well respected in the local Bangladeshi and Islamic communities, active at both the Islamic center and with the South Bay Islamic Association. They immigrated to the United States in the 1980s; Golam Rabbi worked as a quality-assurance engineer and Shamima Rabbi, who earned her degree from San Jose State, was an accountant for several large companies.

“For all purposes, I saw him to be a very humble, polite person just like his wife. They seemed to be normal people like the rest of us. There didn’t seem to be any outward sign of any kind of trouble,” Rahim said. “It’s a huge loss.”

East Side Union High School District Superintendent Chris Funk confirmed that the 17-year-old attends Evergreen and his brother was a graduate. 

“It’s just a tragic incident, and we’re mourning with the community,” he said. 

Attention now turns to laying the Rabbis to rest: The Janaza, or funeral prayer, is scheduled for Friday at the Muslim Community Association in Santa Clara and burial is planned at the Five Pillars Cemetery in Livermore. Religious custom calls for a prompt burial, but initial plans were held up because the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office was allowed to release the victims only to their adult son. Relatives will now take custody of the Rabbis’ remains. 

“Everyone is in shock, but we are desperately looking for some closure,” Rahim said. “The fact that we can offer the final prayer for them gives us some kind of spiritual consolation.”

Staff writers Mark Gomez and Sharon Noguchi contributed to this report.

						Incumbent Savita Vaidhyanathan’s record makes her worthy of being re-elected to the Cupertino City Council.		
	
By Mercury News Editorial Board | Mercury News
PUBLISHED: October 5, 2018 at 6:15 am | UPDATED: October 5, 2018 at 8:51 am


Cupertino is renowned for its schools, diversity and being home to Apple Inc., the company that is synonymous with innovation and Silicon Valley. The city also has a reasonably strong financial position compared to other California cities. But for all of its strengths, Cupertino’s 60,000 residents have been sharply divided for more than a decade on issues connected to growth — namely housing, transportation and the future of the 58-acre Vallco site located in the heart of the city.

Voters need to elect council members who can bridge that divide and make progress attracting more affordable housing for workers and creating more walkable neighborhoods. Three positions are open in the citywide elections. We recommend incumbent Savita Vaidhyanathan, former councilman Orrin Mahoney and Fremont Union High School District board member Hung Wei.

The effort to sharply curb growth in Cupertino is not in the city’s long-term economic interests. Nor will it help Cupertino do its part to help solve the region’s housing and transportation challenges.

Vaidhyanathan, who in 2016 became the first Indo-American mayor in the city’s history, understands the need for balanced development. She voted to approve the Tier 2 development agreement for the dying Vallco Shopping Mall, which would bring nearly 3,000 residential units within a mile of Apple’s new campus. She has supported the Oaks development that would bring more housing for senior citizens while working to make the developers add more community amenities to the project. Vaidhyanathan was a leader in the effort to institute the RYDE program that offers curb-to-curb service for Cupertino’s seniors. She also worked to bring the pilot POGO project to Cupertino High School, a mobile application that facilitates parent carpooling.

Mahoney’s return to the political scene is welcome. He previously served on the Cupertino Planning Commission from 1991-99 and on the council from 2006-14, experience that will allow him to hit the ground running if elected. He is a good listener who understands the need to selectively add to the city’s housing stock while protecting existing single-family neighborhoods’ look and feel.

Wei is a great candidate who would a bring a breath of fresh air to the council. Her outgoing, can-do approach is contagious, which is reflected in her impressive list of endorsements across the political spectrum. She is highly regarded for her work on the Fremont Union High School District board since 2007. Wei wants to collaborate with Apple on transportation and establish a transit hub at the Oaks. She also supports the Tier 2 plan for Vallco and work to ensure that new developments dedicate 20 percent or more of housing to below-market and moderate-income housing.

One other candidate, current Mayor Darcy Paul, is a solid option. He is thoughtful, and his dedication to the city is unquestioned. But his leadership skills are lacking, particularly when it comes to solving the Vallco challenge.
Tara Sreekrishnan’s background as a community organizer in Cupertino shows potential, but she does not have sufficient experience to serve as a councilwoman. Liang Chao is smart and experienced. But she is one of the key leaders of the effort to curb Cupertino’s growth and strongly opposes the Vallco agreement. Jon Willey did not participate in our editorial board sessions. Tim Gorsulowsky is perhaps the most intriguing candidate, given his past experience as a mortician, insurance broker and security business owner. But he lacks experience in political office or holding a significant appointed position in Cupertino.

					
				

Vaidhyanathan, Mahoney and Wei are the best candidates to help drive Cupertino’s future. Voters should elect them Nov. 6.

A man killed Sunday night in San Francisco has been identified by the city’s medical examiner’s office as 42-year-old Scott Turner.

Police believe Turner, a San Francisco resident, was attacked in the 900 block of Geary Street, between Larkin and Polk streets, around 10:25 p.m.

Turner was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries.

Police said an “edged weapon” was involved but have not released further details about how he died. No arrests have been made. Turner’s death is being investigated as a homicide.

Don’t wait for the beep: Voicemail is going the way of the dinosaurs.

Although phone-message technology advanced steadily from cassette recorders attached to landlines to services offered by phone companies to cloud-based message storage for mobile devices, it’s now running up against a changing American society that places increasing value on saving every possible moment of time.

(Click here, if you are unable to view this video on your mobile device.)



The landmark bail-policy case that could free the Ghost Ship defendants, fire danger from electric-car batteries, and a program to help military veterans and rescue dogs are all in today’s Current.

With the prevalence of mobile phones, texting, chat apps and email, voicemail just isn’t as what it used to be.

“Let’s say I get a phone call from my brother,” said Nora Lara, a 50-year-old employee at Santa Clara County Superior Court, who is no fan of voicemail and prefers texting to talking on the phone. “I’ll ignore it. And then he’ll text me. When people leave me voice messages, I just delete them without even checking. If they want to get hold of me, they can text me.”

Roman Basinschi, a 26-year-old software engineer, never uses voicemail. “I don’t think it’s even set up,” he said. Occasionally he’ll leave a voicemail — but only for older people and only in more formal situations.

Lara and Basinchi illustrate a profound and widespread change, one that is re-shaping personal and professional communications and creating a whole new set of rules for how to connect. Voicemail is now seen viewed as inefficient. And for many, that feeling extends to phone conversations in general. These days, a phone call often requires advance scheduling.

The frantic pace of life and work is pushing out phone-based voice communication in favor of text, chat, email and other options seen as more efficient, said Mary Jane Copps, a Canada-based phone-communication consultant known as “The Phone Lady” who gives workshops and consultations across North America.

“We’re all feeling more and more overwhelmed,” Copps said. “We all have less time.”

Businesses began adapting in the past few years to the trend away from voicemail, according to Naomi Baron, an American University linguist who studies language and technology.

In 2014, Coca-Cola scrapped voicemail for employees in a move designed to increase productivity. JPMorgan Chase followed suit in 2015, stripping the service from its consumer-bank workers. Baron said her own university two years ago stopped automatically providing employees with voicemail, and made it an opt-in service.

“There is a death knell being sounded for voicemail in business,” said Baron.

If you’re looking to point a finger at those responsible for the looming demise of voicemail, and the change ways we use our phones, Millennials are an appropriate target, experts said. That’s because they cut their communications teeth on text messaging and emailing, Baron said.

“This is a large generalization, but they don’t feel that comfortable in face-to-face spoken interaction or its derivative over the phone,” Baron said. “They haven’t had the practice. You have far greater control when you can type something out … and then read it again before you send it, and then edit if you choose to.”

Copps sees people under 40 or so as the leaders in the movement against voicemail. Leaving messages for them is usually a waste of time, she said. “They’ve stopped listening to voicemail, so if your phone number shows up on their phone and they recognize your number they’ll call you back, but they won’t listen to your message,” Copps said.

Advertising account manager Tiffany Sung, 24, said she used to talk on the phone a fair amount, but that was back when it cost a dime to send a text. “When texting became unlimited, I stopped making phone calls as much,” said Sung, who typically doesn’t leave voicemails and rarely listens to them except those from her doctor’s office.

Not only is texting usually faster, “You can do it wherever, whenever,” said Cici Tong, 26, an accountant from San Jose.

With people moving away from voicemails and phone calls, we face a whole new series of decisions about how to get in touch with someone, said Anne Ricketts, a communications coach and founder of LIghthouse Communications in San Francisco. It all depends on whom you’re trying to reach, she said.

Among younger adults, a phone call can come as an unwelcome surprise. “lf you don’t schedule it beforehand … people think it’s an emergency, their heart rate goes up,” Ricketts said.

“If it’s more of a formal relationship, I don’t think you text — you email,” Ricketts said. “If it’s a colleague I was comfortable with, I’d just shoot them a text, but I wouldn’t do that with someone I didn’t know very well.”

For matters too complicated to sort out effectively via email or text, a phone call may be required. But that call is best arranged in advance — via email, text or an app, Ricketts said. That’s because voicemail will most likely go unheard.

“In the last three to five years the majority of phone calls in my world are booked ahead of time, just like a meeting,” Copps said, noting that a host of apps are now available to make scheduling calls even easier.

But not every social revolution results in positive change.

“I’m not sure we’re moving toward more efficiency,” Copps said. “We’ve been seduced by text communication. It makes us feel more efficient because we can finish our part of the conversation. We’ve developed a discomfort with conversation.”

In many cases, especially when making logistical plans, text-based communication can actually steal far more time from participants than a quick phone call would, Copps said.

It’s also lot harder to convey and understand emotion and nuance in written language than through spoken words, Copps added. “If I send a client a proposal and they email me back and they say, ‘No,’ or ‘not right now’ … are they saying, “No, we don’t have the budget,’ or, ‘No, but in three weeks we’ll be ready?’ You need tone of voice.”

If you’re going to leave a voicemail, it’s important to hedge your bets, Baron said. She suggests that if you leave one, you should also send a text or email to make sure your message gets through.

In the end, different people and different businesses have different communications practices, which means trial and error is often necessary to figure out how to contact someone, Copps said.

For San Francisco lawyer and California Republican Party national committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon, the decisions depend on the work she’s doing.

“Like any good lawyer, I target my communications according to who is my market and my listener,” Dhillon said. “If I am calling someone in their 80s I leave them a voice message. I don’t text. Frankly, sometimes I don’t even email them.”

But when she’s contacting other lawyers, she said, “An email is likely to be received and processed more promptly than a voice message.” For confidential communication, Dhillon often relies on phone calls, but she won’t answer her phone unless she recognizes the caller’s name.

Ultimately, experts say, talking on the phone may become a prized ability that gives people a leg up in their careers.

“Fewer and fewer people are going to have that skill,” Copps said.

Varun Bhansali, a digital marketer from San Jose, uses text messaging, apps or a gaming platform for most communications. But he admits that spoken conversation still matters in important relationships.

“That’s why, for the people that are close to me, I’ll make sure to pick up the phone and call them once in a while,” said Bhansali, 32. “It gives you a little more of a connection.”

			Travel Troubleshooter: I want some refund help, but Aer Lingus refuses

Dear Travel Troubleshooter: Aer Lingus canceled my recent flight from Dublin to Chicago after an extended delay. Initially, there was an issue with the plane, and then the delay went so long that the flight crew could no longer fly.

The Aer Lingus pilot announced that we should get off the plane, and advised us to either book our own flight home on any airline and Aer Lingus would refund us, or call the phone number we were provided with.

An Aer Lingus representative also told us to get our own hotel, taxi and food — all of which would be refunded. I opted to book a new flight for myself and my two travel companions. I booked us a hotel and also paid for taxis and food.

For more travel coverage from the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond

To date, Aer Lingus has not refunded me or contacted me about my claim for reimbursement, nor has it offered compensation for the canceled flight as required by EU law. I have tried to contact the airline numerous times, including emailing the executives listed on your consumer-advocacy site, but have not heard back.

I need refund help. I’d like Aer Lingus to fully reimburse us for the three flights I had to purchase, the taxis, the food, the hotel and the 600-euro compensation per person owed under EU law.

— Caitlin McNulty, Chicago

Answer: If Aer Lingus promised to refund you for a new flight and your expenses, as well as compensate you under EU law, it should have done so promptly. You shouldn’t need any refund help, but you do.

I’m not sure if the pilot and the Aer Lingus representatives said what you heard. It’s highly unusual — almost unprecedented — for an airline to tell passengers to make their own flight arrangements, hotel reservations and to hire a taxi, and to offer a blank check to customers.

Here’s how it usually works: When there’s a flight cancellation, an airline will offer to rebook travelers on a flight of its choosing, generally with the same carrier. It will offer vouchers for a hotel or transportation. Otherwise, passengers could stay at the Ritz-Carlton and fly back to the States in first class.

I think it’s possible you misunderstood the Aer Lingus representatives, which is too bad. You could have saved yourself a lot of headache by allowing the airline to handle your reservation and accommodations. Instead, maybe because the reps were unclear, you began an odyssey that ended with you asking me for help.

					
				

If someone ever promises you something that looks too good to be true, like a no-questions-asked refund on a plane ticket, get it in writing. That makes the refund process infinitely simpler.

I publish the names, numbers, and email addresses of the Aer Lingus executives on my consumer-advocacy site: www.elliott.org/company-contacts/aer-lingus/. Appealing to them was the right thing to do, but without written proof of the offer, you were out of luck.

I contacted Aer Lingus on your behalf. A representative said that Aer Lingus is “very conscious” of the importance of reliable service. “Regrettably, there will remain isolated occasions where our service will be affected as a result of a technical issue,” she added.

Although she didn’t offer any details about the circumstances of your claim — did the pilot really tell you to rebook the flights yourself? — Aer Lingus agreed to honor most of your expenses. It cut you and your fellow passengers a check for the full amount of the EU-required compensation, plus “reasonable” out-of-pocket expenses of $582.

	As busy week continues, SpaceX lifts Indonesian satellite into orbit aboard reusable rocket, lands first stage on droneship

SpaceX returned its workhorse Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket to space, where it deployed an Indonesian telecommunication satellite late Monday before landing its first stage on a high-tech barge off the Florida coast.
The first stage, on its second mission after being successfully launched and retrieved in May, will be reused as many as eight more times, part of the Hawthorne-based rocketbuilder’s effort to recycle components to cut costs for its clients and make spaceflight more “routine.”



The Falcon 9 lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40  at Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida on Monday at 10:18 PDT (1:18 a.m. Tuesday EDT.) After lobbing the Merah Putih satellite into a Geostationary Transfer Orbit about 30 minutes after launch, the first stage touched down on the whimsically named the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship in the Atlantic.

Merah Putih, a mashup of a name that’s a tribute to the red and white colors of the Indonesian flag, will improve broadband coverage in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. It’s expected to operate for 15 years or longer.
The company did not attempt the recover the fairing on this mission, citing that the “Mr. Steven” capsule-catching craft was still on the West Coast. While rough weather prevented that ship – equipped with four articulated arms and a mammoth net – from catching the nosecone after a July 25 launch from  Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc, Steven was used to carry the fairing home to San Pedro on July 27.
The launch is the 15th this year for Elon Musk’s busy aerospace company. Musk also operates a Tesla electric-car design center in Hawthorne, as well as the headquarters and test tunnel for his Boring Company, which aims to build transit tunnels under Southern California.
The launch continued a stellar week for the commercial rocketbuilder.
On Sunday, the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft, which returned to Earth on Friday from the International Space Station, was toted back home to San Pedro aboard the company’s  NRC Quest ship. The capsule was hoisted from the ship into SpaceX’s facility at the Port of Los Angeles.
SpaceX’s Dragon capsule returned to the Port of Los Angeles Sunday afternoon August 5, 2018. The capsule returned from the International Space Station and splashed down off the coast of Mexico August 3rd. Photo By Charles Bennett Elon Musk’s company took center stage on Friday, too, when NASA intoduced the astronauts who will ride the first commercial capsules into orbit next year and bring crew launches back to the U.S.
SpaceX and fellow aerospace titan Boeing are shooting for a test flight of their capsules by the end of this year or early next, with the first crews flying from Cape Canaveral, Florida, by next spring or summer.
Nine astronauts were named to ride the SpaceX Dragon and Boeing Starliner capsules — five on the first crew flights and four on the second round of missions to the International Space Station.
“For the first time since 2011, we are on the brink of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who made the introductions at Johnson Space Center.

NASA has been paying billions of dollars to SpaceX and Boeing to develop the crew capsules to pick up where the shuttles left off, while also paying billions for cargo deliveries to the space station by SpaceX and Northrop Grumman. The cargo missions started in 2012. The crew missions have been delayed repeatedly because of the technical challenges and difficulties of making spacecraft safe for humans. A recent abort test by Boeing resulted in leaking engine fuel.
Boeing’s Starliners will soar on United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rockets. Dragons, meanwhile, will fly on SpaceX’s own Falcon 9 rockets. The race to get astronauts to the space station first is real; a U.S. flag that flew on the first space shuttle flight in 1981 and the last shuttle flight in 2011, awaits the winner.
SpaceX is shooting for a test flight without passengers in November and a crew flight in April. Boeing is aiming for a test flight at the end of this year or early next, and the first crew flight in the middle of next year.

According to the Associated Press, the “pipe-smoking hedonist … revved up the sexual revolution in the 1950s and built a multimedia empire of clubs, mansions, movies and television, symbolized by bow-tied women in bunny costumes.” He also “was a widely admired but far from universally beloved figure. Many feminist and religious leaders regarded him as nothing but a glorified pornographer who degraded and objectified women with impunity.”
Cartoonists from around the world are weighing in on Hefner’s legacy. See if you agree with their humorous takes on his life.

“Tomb Raider” has always danced on the knife’s edge of reality and myth. The franchise works best when it falls on the side of believability. Lara Croft can explore legendary crypts and battle undead samurai, but without the adventure being grounded in a sensible world, the magic of the game begins to fray.

“Shadow of the Tomb Raider” constantly teeters between the two. The final entry to the rebooted trilogy wraps up Lara’s first story arc as she pursues the secretive Trinity organization to Cozumel, Mexico. Desperate to stop the group that killed her father, she beats them to a knife called the Key of Chak Chel, and during the rush to retrieve it, she unknowingly starts the Mayan apocalypse.

That begins the race between Lara and Trinity leader Dr. Dominguez, for a Silver Box that can stop the cataclysm and give the holder the power to remake the world. It’s a quest that has global ramifications and stretches the fabric of plausibility.

At the start of the campaign, ‘Shadow of the Tomb Raider” handles the apocalypse and Lara’s role in it with an intriguing mystery. Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal wrap the potential apocalypse in cloud of possibility. Players don’t know if the legend is real or metaphorical. They can even question if Lara is the hero in the scenario when compared to the charitable leader Dr. Dominguez.

But as players advance further in “Shadow of the Tomb Raider,” the mystery and gameplay loses its luster. Veterans of the reboot will feel at home with this adventure and its new wrinkles. Lara still relies on her bow and climbing gear. She added a grappling axe and the ability to rappel down cliffs. This opens up new verticality in the world design and creates a situation where traversal becomes a puzzle in its own right.

When it comes to combat, Lara adds a few new moves to improve her stealth. She can cover herself in mode like Arnold Schwarzenegger in “Predator” to hide against vined walls and in other areas. She can climb trees, attack enemies and hang their bodies from above, hiding them from others. The stealth gameplay is as satisfying as ever.

“We wanted this to be a more capable Lara,” said Rich Briggs, Crystal Dynamics’ senior brand director. “She’s at the height of her skills.”

That means “Shadow of the Tomb Raider” has less of an emphasis on Metroidvania-type gating. Lara learns fewer new abilities and those powers don’t have a huge impact on exploration. New areas are blocked off by a required tool such as a reinforced knife or shotgun.

					
				

The bigger change and the flaws lies in the open structure based around hubs. These are centered on Kuwaq Yaku, a small town in the Peruvian jungle, and a hidden city called Paititi. These social areas are where merchants sell items and new gear. It’s also where players chat with locals and pick up sidequests.

These additions introduce more of a role-playing game element, but unfortunately, the optional missions are inconsistent. Few offer compelling stories. Many are just fetch or find quests. Worst of all they take away from “Shadow of the Tomb Raider’s” narrative flow. Players can end up bogged down trying to wrap up tasks and they end up distracted from the main goal.

The other problem with the hubs is that they feel static, especially in Paititi. Villagers are always in the same position and don’t go about their day. Visiting the towns is more like exploring an animatronic theme park experiencing than a living and breathing world, and this causes problems with believability, especially with the conflict between the two factions within the city.

That’s compounded by the way outfits are used. The outfits are another RPG element and give Lara what’s essentially armor with stat boosts and bonuses. Some are also used to blend in with locals, but the disguises aren’t totally convincing. Nor do they fit plausibly with the overarching narrative.

The second bothersome part is that players have the ability to fast-travel early and they’ll constantly find themselves backtracking for the sole purpose of opening a chest or a crypt. There’s no practical benefit of going back, such as opening pathways or shortcuts. Although convenient, fast-travel chips away at the cohesive logic of the world.

Although “Shadow of the Tomb Raider” has issues with the world-building, the developers did a good job with Lara’s character development. They show a darker side of the hero as she fights her inner demons. According to Briggs, it’s a story arc that has been in the works since the beginning.

“Yes, we knew where we wanted her to end up,” he said,”but how to get there was the question.”

The journey that Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal creates for Lara is far from perfect, but for fans and newcomers, “Shadow of the Tomb Raider” offers a fitting conclusion to a story arc that reinvented her character.

Today’s reality is that public-sector unions are conveyor belts to move part of public employees’ salaries into political campaigns, mostly Democrats’.

						Supreme Court		
	
By George F. Will | The Washington Post
PUBLISHED: July 3, 2018 at 6:56 am | UPDATED: July 3, 2018 at 7:01 am


WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is especially admirable when correcting especially deplorable prior decisions, as with the 1954 school desegregation decision rejecting a 1896 decision’s “separate but equal” doctrine. It did so again last Wednesday, overturning a 41-year-old precedent inimical to the First Amendment.

Shortly before the court made this predictable ruling, a Wall Street Journal headline revealed why it was necessary. The headline said: “Unions Court Own Members Ahead of Ruling.” Anticipating defeat, government-employee unions had begun resorting to persuasion — imagine that — in the hope of retaining members and convincing nonmembers to continue making payments to the unions that the court says can no longer be obligatory.

In 1977, the court upheld, 6-3, the constitutionality of compelling government employees who exercise their right not to join a union to pay “fair share” or “agency” fees. These, which the union determines, supposedly cover only the costs of collective bargaining from which nonmembers benefit. But the payments usually are much more than half of, and sometimes equal to, dues that members pay.

The majority opinion in 1977 admitted something that was too obvious to deny and so constitutionality problematic that a future challenge was inevitable. That majority said: “There can be no quarrel with the truism that, because public employee unions attempt to influence government policymaking, their activities … may be properly termed political.” And one justice, concurring with the majority, said “the ultimate objective of a union in the public sector, like that of a political party, is to influence public decision-making.” (Emphasis added.)

Actually, everything public-sector unions do is political. Therefore, the 1977 decision made compulsory political contributions constitutional. Which made the court queasy.

By 2014, it was affirming the principle that doomed the 1977 decision and foretold Wednesday’s: It is a “bedrock principle that, except perhaps in the rarest of circumstances, no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support.” Which is what the court now says regarding compulsory financial support of government-employee unions. Yet Justice Elena Kagan, in her uncharacteristically strident dissent, said:

“There is no sugarcoating today’s opinion. The majority overthrows a decision entrenched in this nation’s law — and in its economic life — for over 40 years. As a result, it prevents the American people, acting through their state and local officials, from making important choices about workplace governance. And it does so by weaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy.”

					
				

How does Kagan err? Let us count the ways.

The 1977 decision was no more entrenched than the 1896 “separate but equal” decision was for 58 years. The First Amendment exists to prevent the people’s representatives from making certain kinds of choices (“Congress shall make no law … “). Wednesday’s decision was not about “workplace governance” or “economic and regulatory policy.” It was about coerced speech. And about denial of another First Amendment guarantee, freedom of association, which includes the freedom not to associate, through coerced financial support, with uncongenial political organizations. And judges are supposed to be unleashed to wield the First Amendment as a weapon against officials perpetrating such abuses.

Wednesday’s 5-4 decision accords with President Franklin Roosevelt’s judgment that “the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service.” In private-sector bargaining, unions contest management concerning the distribution of companies’ profits. In the public sector, government gets its revenues from a third party — taxpayers. Because a majority of organized labor’s members are government employees, the labor movement is mostly not horny-handed sons of toil. It increasingly is government organized as an interest group that pressures government to do what it has a metabolic urge to do anyway: grow.

The deadliest dagger in Wednesday’s decision was the stipulation that nonmembers’ fees cannot be automatically deducted from their wages — nonmembers must affirmatively consent to deductions. So, public-sector unions must persuade people. No wonder they are panicking.

There is no sugarcoating today’s reality. Public-sector unions are conveyor belts that move a portion of government employees’ salaries — some of the amount paid in union dues — into political campaigns, almost always Democrats’, to elect the people with whom the unions “negotiate” for taxpayers’ money. Progressives who are theatrically distraught about there being “too much money in politics” are now theatrically distraught that the court has ended coercing contributions that have flowed to progressive candidates.

Before more harm is done, he needs to find the proper therapist to help him through this.

DEAR CAROLYN: I’m trying to figure out how to approach my husband, who over the past year has developed an undercurrent of anger that bursts out not infrequently, particularly toward our 5-year-old son.

The anger is probably coming from watching his mother deteriorate; her memory is going, and we see her many times a week so we have front-row seats. I wish he’d see a therapist, but he’s done it before and says, “It doesn’t work for me” — although I noticed the other day when he took his mom to a support group that included caregivers, he was distinctly calmer and softer afterward.

My main worry is for my son, who’s a wonderful guy but very typical for his age with squirming, not putting on shoes, etc. I’ve tried several tactics and the best one seems to be to retain a strong bond with my husband (rather than just get mad at him), even while defending our son. And he’s gotten better over the course of the year. But do you have any other thoughts or tips/techniques for how to approach someone who’s in a crisis that’s affecting others, but won’t get help?
Anger Issues

DEAR ANGER ISSUES: Oh my goodness this makes me nuts. Therapy is not a single thing, like penicillin, where it’s useless if you’re allergic or have a virus. Therapy is a range of treatments that varies with the type of training and strategy, the goals, the underlying condition being treated, and the skill level and even personality of the therapist. Therapy with one therapist is just that, a data set of one.

And being the parent of a 5-year-old child you’re yelling at for squirming means you have a higher responsibility than to your own preconceived notions about mental health care.

These arguments are for your husband, obviously — so please convey them. His past therapy experience is not relevant now. What is relevant is his mismanaged anger, particularly its impact on a child. Sometimes, adults must set themselves aside for a greater good.

And sometimes they also have to shop around for the right therapist. Talk to those caregivers at the support group; I bet they have ideas.

And while I advise this with some trepidation because it can easily come off as snark, your husband’s own words might serve you best: “Your untreated anger doesn’t work for me, either, and it’s not working for our boy. You’re a good man with a good heart and you’re under a lot of pressure — and you’re grieving. Please let me help you take care of your mom by finding supportive care for you.”

					
				

Maybe he’d agree to grief support? Or a support group for caregivers? Then he could tell himself it’s not therapy. Whatever gets it done.

DEAR CAROLYN: 

Re: Anger

Right now, today, you can suggest that he find another outlet for his (perfectly normal) anger and frustration with his mother’s impending death. Get him some self-care: respite, time for a self-soothing hobby, more sleep, maybe a nice anger outlet like a heavy bag or time at the shooting range. You can do this AND act as a buffer between him and your son AND point out this current dynamic can’t continue. And sure, if you can get him to therapy, great.

						File photo shows San Jose students practicing for the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP). (LiPo Ching/Bay Area News Group)		
	
By Sharon Noguchi | snoguchi@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: September 27, 2017 at 9:00 am | UPDATED: September 28, 2017 at 11:37 am


Breaking with its steadily upward trend, California’s annual test scores have stagnated, with fewer than half of students proficient in math and English, and a wide ethnic achievement gap persisting.

State scores released Wednesday show just 49 percent of students proficient in English and 37 percent proficient in math. The numbers are half a percentage-point different from 2016 — down in English and up in math. Tests were administered last spring to students in third through eighth grades and 11th grade.

The state’s education leaders played down officials’ attitude.

“Test scores are not the only way to look at how students are doing,” state Board of Education President Michael Kirst, a professor emeritus at Stanford, wrote in an email. He cited graduation rates, suspension, enrollment in college-prep and advanced-placement classes as other measures of school performance.

“Our watchwords are patience, persistence, humility and continuous improvement,” he wrote.

Likewise, Tom Torlakson, state superintendent of schools, issued a written statement celebrating 2016 gains (of 3 percent), the number of students tested (3.2 million) and the rigor of the tests.

Critics, however, lambasted those responses.

“The state has given itself permission to fail,” said Ryan Smith, executive director of the Education Trust-West, an Oakland-based research and advocacy organization.

As evidence of that, he said, “couple scores with an accountability plan that doesn’t hold schools responsible and a report card that parents need a degree in analytics to read.” He was referring to California’s education plan that critics see as letting failing schools off the hook, and the state’s colorful but confusing online “dashboard” that’s intended to depict school progress.

					
				

California isn’t alone in its stagnating scores and in fact compares favorably with the 12 other states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands, that administered the same tests last spring from the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. Scores decreased in every state, and California’s decline was about the smallest, retired educational testing specialist Douglas McRae said.

Those languishing scores have raised questions about the quality of the test itself.

“It stands out like a sore thumb,” said McRae, of Monterey. “You have to ask the question: Is it because of the performance of students in schools, or is it something with the test?”

McRae thinks the test is faulty.

Statewide, scores flatlined, from high-scoring suburbs to inner cities and rural areas.

In both the Fremont and Pleasanton unified school districts, English and math scores were identical to previous years. In Palo Alto, where high scores fuel a roaring housing market, both math and English scores fell 3 points. In the San Mateo-Foster City School District, scores in various grade levels and sub-areas were flat or declined up to 2 percentage points — “not a significant change,” spokeswoman Amber Farinha wrote in an email.

The plateau in scores is not surprising after second-year familiarity with the tests bumped up scores, Gilroy Unified Superintendent Debbie Flores said in an email. Her district dropped 1 point in English, to 48, and stayed at 40 in math.

Charter schools posted varied scores but mostly reflected the marginal changes that other public schools did. Rocketship Education’s 12 Bay Area elementary schools (its newest campus did not have reportable scores) gained 3 points, reaching 44 percent in English and 54 percent in math. The charter chain serves predominantly students from poor and immigrant families.

Last spring was the third administration of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, aswhich includes Smarter Balanced and other examsis known in this state  and which replaced tests in the previous STAR system. The CAASPP It is a computer adaptive test — meaning as the test progresses, questions become harder or easier depending on the student’s answers. The test also includes “performance tasks” where students apply knowledge to analyze a real-world problem.

While proficiency levels took a dive when the state switched from multiple-choice tests to the more sophisticated and challenging CAASPP, scores were expected to rise as the Common Core curriculum and the tests became more familiar.

McRae cites national data indicating a test problem and decries the opaque testing body that he said has refused to divulge critical information that could help analyze the integrity of the test.

Flat or declining test scores alone do not signal a school problem, especially in districts such as Piedmont Unified, where scores fell but remain in the mid-80s.

But persistently low achievement rates of African-American, Latino, poor, English-learner and disabled students, who together make up a majority of the state’s public-school students, fuel criticism of the educational status quo.

In Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, home to some of the state’s highest-performing schools, Latino English proficiency is identical to the state’s: 37 percent. Latino math proficiency in the two counties is 27 percent, two points higher than the state figure — but more than 50 points lower than Asian math proficiency in the counties.

 

Several Bay Area school districts serving large numbers of Latinos can’t even match the state’s proficiency levels. San Jose Unified’s Latino math proficiency is 22 percent, a 1-point increase from last year, but 5 points below the state. The figures are 21 percent in Mount Diablo Unified in Concord, 16 percent in West Contra Costa Unified in Richmond, and 15 percent in Oakland Unified. Scores for African-American students are equally dismal.

“Any parent looking at these numbers is justifiably alarmed,” Matt Hammer, CEO of the advocacy group Innovate Public Schools, wrote in an email.

Those numbers dismay critics who see no political will to act. “California’s current direction is not moving us forward,” said Smith, who blames state leaders, from Gov. Jerry Brown on down. “There’s a lack of a sense of urgency on this issue.”



Finding your school’s test scores

For 2017 school, district, county and state standardized test results, go to caaspp.cde.ca.gov, then click on “English Language Arts/Literacy and Mathematics.”

On the next page, click on the blue “Search Smarter Balanced Results.” On the following page, select either “View Statewide Results” or select the county and, if desired, school district, then school. (Most charter schools are listed among the school districts.) Click on “View Test Results.”

The resulting page will show test scores for all students of your selected school. Click on “Select Student Group/Subgroup” to see results by gender, ethnicity, poverty and other categories.

Note: Results of the California Alternate Assessments, given to some special-education students, and of state science exams will not be posted until later this year.

	Stocks suffer worst loss in 8 months

					Apple gave up 4.6 percent to $216.36 and Microsoft dropped 5.4 percent to $106.16. Amazon skidded 6.2 percent to $1,755.25. Industrial and internet companies also fell hard. Boeing lost 4.7 percent to $367.57 and Alphabet, Google's parent company, gave up 4.6 percent to $1,092.16.
				

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks plunged to their worst loss in eight months on Wednesday as technology companies continued to drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 831 points.
The losses were widespread, and stocks that have been the biggest winners on the market the last few years, including technology companies and retailers, suffered steep declines. Apple and Amazon both had their worst day in two and a half years.
The Nasdaq composite, which has a high concentration of technology companies, had its biggest loss in more than two years.


Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, said investors fear that rising interest rates and growing expenses are going to erode company profits next year.
“The tax cuts juiced earnings this year and that’s not sustainable,” he said. “The market’s starting to say that the glass may be half empty.”
The S&P 500 index sank 94.66 points, or 3.3 percent, to 2,785.68. The benchmark index fell for the fifth straight day, which hadn’t happened since just before the 2016 presidential election.
The Nasdaq composite tumbled 315.97 points, or 4.1 percent, to 7,422.05. It’s fallen 7.5 percent in just five days.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 831.83 points, or 3.1 percent, to 25,598.74. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks shed 46.45 points, or 2.9 percent, to 1,575.41.
After a long stretch of relative calm, the stock market has suffered sharp losses over the last week as bond yields surged. Stocks had come close to big drops in the last few days, but each time they recovered some of their losses. That didn’t happen Wednesday as stocks fell further late in the day.
Apple gave up 4.6 percent to $216.36 and Microsoft dropped 5.4 percent to $106.16. Amazon skidded 6.2 percent to $1,755.25. Industrial and internet companies also fell hard. Boeing lost 4.7 percent to $367.57 and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, gave up 4.6 percent to $1,092.16.
Insurance companies dropped as Hurricane Michael continued to gather strength and came ashore in Florida bringing winds of up to 155 miles an hour. Berkshire Hathaway dipped 4.7 percent to $213.10 and reinsurer Everest Re slid 5.1 percent to $217.73.
Luxury retailers tumbled after LVMH, the parent of Louis Vuitton, said its sales growth in China slowed. Tiffany plunged 10.2 percent to $110.38 and Ralph Lauren fell 8.4 percent to $116.96.
The biggest driver for the market over the last week has been interest rates, which began spurting higher following several encouraging reports on the economy.
Higher rates can slow economic growth, erode corporate profits and make investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks.
The 10-year Treasury yield remained at 3.20 percent, about where it was late Tuesday, after earlier touching 3.24 percent. It was at just 3.05 percent early last week and 2.82 percent in late August.
Technology and internet-based companies are known for their high profit margins, and many have reported explosive growth in recent years, with corresponding gains in their stock prices.
Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, said the stocks have become more volatile in the last few months because investors have concerns about their future profitability.
“Amazon recently announced they were increasing wages, Facebook is spending a ton on security,” she said. “Semiconductors have the most exposure to China out of segments in the S&P 500.”
Sears Holdings nosedived after the Wall Street Journal reported that the struggling retailer hired an advisory firm to prepare a bankruptcy filing that could come within days. The stock fell 16.8 percent to 49 cents. It was more than $40 five years ago.
Sears has closed hundreds of stores and sold several famous brands or put them on the block as it sees more customers abandon its stores.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 2.4 percent to $73.17 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 2.2 percent to $83.09 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline shed 2.7 percent to $2.02 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1.2 percent to $2.39 a gallon. Natural gas rose 0.6 percent to $3.28 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,193.40 an ounce. Silver dipped 0.5 percent to $14.33 an ounce. Copper fell 0.9 percent to $2.78 a pound.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 0.2 percent, South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.1 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 0.1 percent.
The CAC 40 in France dropped 2.1 percent, Germany’s DAX lost 2.2 percent and the FTSE 100 in London fell 1.3 percent.
Stocks from emerging markets were also hard hit. Investors see many of these countries as being vulnerable to higher U.S. interest rates, which can pull away investment dollars. Brazil’s Bovespa lost 2.5 percent and the Merval in Argentina sank 2.2 percent.
The dollar fell to 112.59 Japanese yen from 113.05 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.1525 from $1.1496. The British pound rose to $1.3197 from $1.3146.

	One franchise already dominates its sport, the other feels it has the pieces to get back on top very soon. Dieter Kurtenbach welcomes Jacob Palmer of the San Francisco Examiner to take a look at what the offseason in the NFC West has meant to the 49ers, and ask why Golden State is so confident they can handle the Houston Rockets in the playoffs?

By Andrew Gilbert | Correspondent
PUBLISHED: September 19, 2018 at 8:30 am | UPDATED: September 19, 2018 at 2:51 pm


There’s no shortage of big-name acts playing the main arena at the Monterey Jazz Festival this weekend.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning trumpeter Wynton Marsalis leads the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra,  and multi-platinum selling vocalist/pianist Norah Jones introduces the West Coast to her all-star trio with drummer Brian Blade.

Infectiously charismatic New Orleans pianist Jon Batiste, taking a break from his bandleader duties on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” teams up with the Dap Kings in the band’s first major collaboration since powerhouse soul singer Sharon Jones’ death in Nov. 2016. And tenor saxophonist/flutist Charles Lloyd performs with The Marvels and special guest Lucinda Williams, returning to the stage that catapulted him into the rock-star firmament in 1966.



The marquee artists are in the arena, but to discover some of the treasures of the local jazz scene, the place to hunt is the grounds, where one ticket provides entree to four different venues. There are plenty of excellent out-of-town players featured on the Monterey County Fairgrounds, too, but the festival has long thrived by feeding off the synergy created in spotlighting masters resident in its own backyard. Of course, it helps when you think of the lawn extending down to San Diego.

“I think any good arts organization has to reflect your community and be part of it,” says Tim Jackson, the MJF’s longtime artistic director. “You have to keep in mind all the great musicians out there. It’s more than the Bay Area. I make sure we stay focused on the Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz, even down to Los Angeles, which I really count as kind of local. I do feel a strong allegiance.”

Los Angeles-based Katie Thiroux and her trio will make an appearance at this year’s Monterey Jazz Festival. MONTEREY JAZZ FESTIVAL

Tapping into the roiling creativity of the Southland scene, Jackson booked L.A. bassist/vocalist Katie Thiroux’s trio, which played an exceptionally engaging set as part of San Jose Jazz’s Summer Fest last month, and West Coast Get Down pianist Cameron Graves’ quartet with drummer Mike Mitchell, an act spun off from the Kamasi Washington constellation. But no region west of New York City is better represented on the fairgrounds than the greater Bay Area.

San Jose guitarist Hristo Vitchev kicks off the festival Friday on the outdoor Garden Stage, followed by San Francisco pianist Tammy L. Hall’s Peace-tet with special guest vocalist Kim Nalley. The last time Hall played Monterey, she was backing Nalley, and she’s best known as a supremely accomplished accompanist via her work with many of the region’s finest singers.

Featuring veteran bassist Ruth Davies, drummer Ruthie Price, percussionist Michaelle Goerlitz and saxophonist Kristen Strom, Hall’s Peace-tet highlights another thread running through this season’s programming, the conspicuous presence of more women bandleaders and instrumentalists than ever before. Hall credits the sea change at least partly to advocacy spearheaded by East Bay trumpeter Ellen Seeling, co-leader of the Montclair Women’s Big Band (which played the festival in 2016), and a catalyst behind the all-male Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra adopting blind auditions.

					
				

“Tim has been extremely supportive over the years,” Hall says. “But I think Ellen Seeling and her advocacy group has been heard, and you can see that on the fairgrounds this year.”

At about the same time that Hall’s Peace-tet is on stage Friday, Oakland bassist/composer Lisa Mezzacappa performs in the intimate Pacific Jazz Café with her antic avantNOIR sextet, a group that plays her cunningly crafted original music inspired by film noir and hard-boiled crime novels. And on Saturday afternoon in Dizzy’s Den, Kristen Strom celebrates the release of “Moving Day,” a new album dedicated to the gorgeous music of the late, beloved San Jose bassist John Shifflett.

“I like to look for and recognize those undersung gems,” Tim Jackson says. “John was certainly that. Any group that he was part of he raised the musical level. He was a quiet, unassuming guy, but very clear in his musical direction, and all the musicians loved playing with him. That personality type can fly a little under the radar. When I saw Kris was doing this project, I told her  I’d love to present it.”

Saturday’s roster in the Night Club features a bevy of artists who should be more widely celebrated, as Oakland percussion great John Santos presents his Unusual Standards sextet with the spectacular vocalists Kenny Washington and Destani Wolf (who’s heading off to India in the fall with a major role in Cirque du Soleil’s new show “Bazzar”).
But from rising players like the teenage Monterey-area sisters Akili and Ayana Bradley (on trumpet and piano, respectively), who follow Strom’s Moving Day Saturday afternoon in Dizzy’s Den, to the festival’s artists-in-residence Tia Fuller (alto sax) and Ingrid Jensen (trumpet), “the women in jazz story is pervasive,” Jackson says. “There are so many incredible women-led groups now, this felt like the right thing to do.”

	CEOs speak: Colorado’s DiStefano, Arizona’s Robbins talk media strategy, support leadership and address football’s place in the Pac-12 world

		
	Jon Wilner
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 27, 2018 at 11:40 am | UPDATED: September 27, 2018 at 7:44 pm

	  
		Categories:
		College Sports, Sports	



	The new boss of the bosses in the Pac-12 believes all options should be considered for using the conference’s media content to create maximum value for the schools — even if it means selling an equity stake in the Pac-12 Networks or renegotiating the contracts with ESPN and Fox before their expiration.
That eye-opening strategic vision comes from Colorado chancellor Phil DiStefano, the new chair of the Pac-12’s board of directors (the presidents and chancellors).
“No decisions have been made, but we should start looking at what possibilities exist for leveraging the networks,” DiStefano told the Hotline during a recent interview.


“I’m open to thinking outside the box. Let’s put as many things on the table as possible.”
Those considerations should include selling an equity stake in the Pac-12 Networks, which would create a partnership akin to what the Big Ten Network has with Fox, and/or renegotiating the $3 billion Tier 1 contracts with ESPN and Fox.
The conference’s Tier 1 deal runs through the summer of 2024; that’s one year after the expiration of the Big Ten’s major media contracts.
“There are challenges in the next three-to-five years,” DiStefano said. “Which way are the winds blowing? Should we get in before the Big Ten, or is it better to wait and see what the Big Ten does?
“I don’t have the answers, but I think we need to ask those questions.”
DiStefano’s comments on media strategy were the top takeaway from a Hotline project designed to gauge the sentiment at the top of the conference’s chain of command.
Several university presidents/chancellors have spoken publicly in the past year about the state of affairs, either praising the direction of the conference (Oregon State’s Ed Ray and Arizona State’s Michael Crow) or expressing concerns about financial matters (Cal’s Carol Christ and Washington State’s Kirk Schulz).
At the same time, there has been significant turnover at the executive level. Only three presidents/chancellors remain from the group that hired commissioner Larry Scott in 2009 (Ray, Crow and UCLA’s Gene Block), and many others have come aboard in the past few years.
The Hotline sought comment from five executives who have been on the job for at least a year (on a permanent, not interim, basis) but haven’t expressed their views on conference matters in media interviews: Washington’s Ana Mari Cauce, Oregon’s Michael Schill, UCLA’s Block, Colorado’s DiStefano and Arizona’s Robbins.
Three of the five declined to be interviewed (through a spokesperson), but DiStefano and Robbins agreed to discuss a wide range of subjects, from the state of the networks to the place of football in the Pac-12 universe to the revenue gap with other Power Five conferences.
Both were generally positive on the state of affairs and echoed many of Scott’s recent comments.
Robbins, a serious sports fan whose tenure in Tucson began in the late spring of 2017, said he was “learning as fast as I  can” and is “very interested and passionate and want to make the best deals we can make.”
(Robbins’ comments, which include references to Wayne Gretzky and Herm Edwards when he was with the Jets, have been published separately in their entirety. They are insightful, entertaining and shed light on his personality.)
DiStefano, who has worked at CU for more than four decades and been chancellor since 2009 — before the Buffaloes joined the conference — was comfortable talking specifics, particularly in regard to finances, strategic thinking and media rights.
Three key points from the interviews:
* Both Robbins and DiStefano expressed support for conference leadership, with DiStefano noting Scott’s proactive approach to the college basketball scandal. (He created a task force, whose findings were forwarded to the NCAA’s commission.)
“That type of leadership is very important,” DiStefano said.
Added Robbins: “I’m very supportive of commissioner Scott and the collective wisdom of those who have been around.”
* Both Robbins and DiStefano echoed Scott’s comments from football media day in July about the importance of success across all sports, not just football.
“I take a more holistic view of things,” said DiStefano, who was CU’s Faculty Athletic Representative before being named chancellor. “I try not to look at one year at a time but, overall, how well are we doing … I agree with (Scott) in that I’m concerned with welfare of all the student athletes.”
Robbins grew up in Mississippi and earned a degree in the SEC (Ole Miss).
“In the South, there’s football and there’s spring football, and those are the only two seasons that matter,” he said. “But we have such an incredible group of student-athletes …
“I think when the presidents get together, and I’m sure when the athletic directors get together, they’re not saying, ‘Football is important, but we need to focus more on cross country.’ We need to focus on it all. That’s why we earned that monicker the Conference of Champions. But let’s be clear about it: I would love to see a Pac-12 team win the national championship every year.”
• Lastly, both Robbins and DiStefano acknowledged the gap in revenue distributed by the Pac-12 to the campuses, as compared to other Power Five conferences.
The SEC and Big Ten distribute between $10 million and $20 million more to each member school than does the Pac-12, a disparity that could impact the conference’s ability to compete on important fronts like facilities and coaching salaries.
Absent a significant new revenue stream, the gap will remain fixed until the next round of media rights contracts in six years.
“Early on, the conference was counting on DirecTV as a way to increase revenue,” DiStefano said. “We need to work with the commissioner and the other presidents and chancellors to get as prepared for new contract talks as we can, and how we can use the media as a way of leveraging additional income in the future …
“What can we do in the meantime? We can keep working for more subscribers, but each one of us needs to be more innovative in how we use additional resources.
“That’s not going to get us to where the Big Ten and SEC are. But instead of sitting back and waiting for the next negotiation, each campus should look ways to generate additional revenue.”
(It should be noted that DiStefano’s willingness to explore options in the media world neither supports nor contradicts Scott’s public position. To the best of our knowledge, Scott has neither been asked about, or commented on the topic recently. In the past, he has said the conference periodically examines the landscape.)
Robbins was realistic in the short term — “There’s no question, just go to the data: We’ve got a gap” — but is bullish on the future and praised the decision to retain 100 percent ownership in the Pac-12 Networks.
“I believe in the long term, we will win out and be successful,” he said.
“I hope this conversation in three-five-10 years from now is, ‘Wow, those guys’ — meaning Pac-12 leadership — “saw it. They saw it coming, and we got locked in. We made more money on the front end than they did, but boy did they hit a home run because they held tight under enormous criticism.’

In addition to his comments on media strategy, Scott’s leadership and the role of Olympic sports, DiStefano touched on two other topics:
On Colorado’s move to the Pac-12:
“I get asked all the time: ‘Are you pleased you made the move?’ Definitely, I am. It made a great deal of sense. Our largest alumni population outside Colorado is in California.”
On any changes he’s like to see as the new chair of the Pac-12 board:
(He replaces USC’s Max Nikias, who resigned from his post, under pressure, this summer.)
“As chair, I want to continue with more collaboration between the presidents, athletic directors and the commissioner. It’s important to have that type of collaboration, so we’re all hearing the same thing. I’m a huge believer in collaboration.”

			Sam Liccardo and Chuck Reed: Measure B settlement is right for San Jose

By Sam Liccardo, Chuck Reed and Special to the Mercury News | 
August 7, 2015 at 6:20 am


For both of our mayoral administrations, three objectives have guided our negotiations to settle litigation with our police and fire unions over pension reform: 

First, reducing the costs of unsustainable retirement benefits; second, ensuring that the pension system does not add to the $3 billion in unfunded liabilities already thrust on future generations; and third, reaching a settlement that enables us to rebuild San Jose’s shrinking police force. 

The agreement reached in July accomplishes all three. 

First, it will save taxpayer dollars. The calculations of city staff and an independent actuary (whose report is linked to this column at www.mercurynews.com/opinion) show we’ll achieve $1.7 billion in cost reductions over the next three decades compared to the retirement benefits fire and police received as recently as 2012. 

And that does not include additional savings that can emerge through pending negotiations with the city’s other nine unions.   

How does this $ 1.7 billion compare to the savings we sought through Measure B, the pension reform measure approved by the voters and now contested in litigation?   

In health benefits, this settlement offers savings of $244 million over 30 years that we did not achieve in Measure B. This was accomplished by closing the retiree medical plan — eliminating the defined retiree health care benefit for newly hired employees and providing incentives for current employees to opt into a less expensive plan. 

On pensions, the settlement offers a Goldilocks solution between the fiscally soft benefit structure that existed prior to Measure B and the harder alternative in the measure that caused some police officers to leave for cities that paid better. 

It creates a pension plan competitive with other police departments’ plans, but it will cost less. It will save taxpayers 80 percent of what Measure B would have saved, or about $1.15 billion over 30 years.  

					
				

The settlement also eliminates the supplemental pension benefit, known as the “bonus check,” saving $270 million over 30 years, while still protecting existing lower-income retirees with a much less expensive benefit. 

The agreement would not include savings contemplated by Measure B’s mandate for employees to pay up to an additional 16 percent of their salaries for pensions. We would need to chase those savings down a long and perilous road, however, spending millions in litigation over several years to appeal to the California Supreme Court. If we failed, we’d lose the $1.7 billion in savings achieved by this settlement, not to mention many more longtime employees who would be likely to resign. 

Our residents and our employees deserve the certainty of resolution — and of those savings — today. 

This agreement sharply reduces the likelihood of saddling future generations with additional unfunded debt. Halting any future commitment of defined retiree medical benefits forecloses the creation of new liabilities in that plan. San Jose would be one of the first major cities in the nation to do this. 

The settlement also preserves modified forms of Measure B mandates for sharing future pension costs 50/50 by employees and the city, prohibiting retroactive enhancement of benefits and curbing disability abuses. 

Finally, reaching an agreement goes a long way toward aligning our officers, firefighters and the city in a common imperative: rebuilding our public safety departments. 

With new leadership in those unions and departments, we have a unique opportunity to do so collaboratively. 

To be sure, neither side got everything it wanted in this settlement. In a serious negotiation, nobody ever does. 

The important question is whether both sides accomplished their key objectives.

They did, and San Jose is better for it.

Sam Liccardo became mayor of San Jose this year, and Chuck Reed was mayor the previous eight years. They wrote this for this newspaper.

							(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group)

						The Cleveland Cavaliers’ LeBron James (23) urges teammate J.R. Smith (5) to shoot or pass in the waning seconds of the fourth quarter in Game 1 of the NBA Finals at Oracle Arena on Thursday night, May 31, 2018. The Warriors beat the Cavaliers in overtime, 124-114.		
	
By Gary Peterson | gpeterson@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: September 30, 2018 at 12:20 pm | UPDATED: October 1, 2018 at 4:22 am


J.R. Smith of the Cleveland Cavaliers has a new tattoo. In a related note, the sun rose in the east this morning.

Smith collects tattoos the way J. Paul Getty collected Baroque paintings — in bulk. Recently Smith added to his collection a big, bold, vertical tat on his right calf which reads: “Supreme.” Supreme, according to USA Today, is a New York “streetwear” company.

According to multiple media outlets, the NBA caught wind of the tattoo. A league spokesman told The Athletic that it violates the NBA’s uniform policy which prohibits “players from displaying any commercial logos or corporate insignia on their body or in their hair.” The NBA has told Smith he will have to cover his tattoo during games or face a fine.

Smith, who told Sports Illustrated he is not being compensated by Supreme, fired back in an Instragram post which we can’t publish because it contains language not safe for work, or when the parson drops by for Sunday supper.

But we can excerpt.

“I swear I’m the only person they do (stuff) like this to!” Smith ranted. “You don’t make people cover up Jordan logos NIKE checks or anything else but because it’s me it’s a problem all of a sudden!!!”

According to Spotrac.com, no NBA player has been fined for violating the league’s uniform policy since 2010. According to the database, Smith has been fined on 31 occasions during that time, for everything from unsportsmanlike conduct, ejection, flopping (it was a thing in 2013), two social media violations, and a slew of technical fouls.

It might interest Smith, when he calms down, to know that golfer Lee Trevino faced a similarly ticklish tattoo situation back in the day. Trevino was a charismatic fellow who won six majors. That’s not the part that is likely to interest Smith. This might:

He even reached out to the makers of Band-Aid to see if they could to a little business.
					
				

Alas, they could not.

	Mavericks surf contest permit could be sold to WSL

					Surfers take advantage of the recent high surf to ride the giant waves at the Mavericks surf break near Half Moon Bay in January. The World Surf League may soon hold the permit for the Maverick's big wave surf contest after Cartel Management sought approval of a sale through bankruptcy court Wednesday. (Patrick Tehan/Bay Area News Group file) 
				

Stay up to date on breaking news with our mobile app from the Apple app store  or the Google Play store.Maverick’s may become part of the World Surfing League’s Big Wave Tour after all.
Cartel Management, Inc., on Wednesday sought approval from a bankruptcy court to sell some of its assets to the WSL. According to documents filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court Central District’s Los Angeles Division and obtained by the Sentinel, “The Purchased Assets specifically include, without limitation, the Special Use Permit Number 2016-01 (5-Year term: 2016/2017 through 2020/2021) issued by the San Mateo County Harbor District.”
The sale of the five-year permit would be contingent on the harbor district approving the sale and the transfer of the permit at its Sept. 20 meeting. The permit serves as the cornerstone among more than a dozen permits needed to host the contest at the big-wave break near Pillar Point Harbor in Half Moon Bay.


The purchase price would be $525,000, according to the documents, little more than half of the minimum $1 million that Cartel was asking when it originally put its assets up for bid in June.
Cartel Management filed for Chapter 11 protections in late January, midway through what was supposed to be the window for its second Titans of Mavericks surf contest. Nic Lamb of Santa Cruz won the first Titans contest in 2016.
At the time, Cartel faced nearly $2 million in claims and Titans of Mavericks more than $776,335 in claims from their top 20 creditors.
The sale is expected to be completed no later than Oct. 3.

	As Capitol wildfire debate rages, utilities have doubled dollars on lobbying

Between last year’s deadly wildfires and this summer’s fatal blazes, utilities and insurers with a huge stake in the aftermath have poured more than $3.2 million into California campaign donations and another $5.2 million into lobbying at the state Capitol — a big spike.
Also fiercely lobbying on wildfire bills: plaintiffs attorneys, local governments and electrical worker unions.
Now, in the final weeks of the Legislature’s session, lawmakers on a special wildfire committee are considering proposals to beef up safety of the electrical system and change liability laws. CALmatters reviewed new lobbying and campaign finance reports covering the first six months of the year. The takeaways:


Lobbying is up — by a lot
The state’s three big electric utilities together more than doubled their spending on lobbying during the first half of this year, compared with the same period last year. The increase was driven largely by Pacific Gas & Electric, which spent $2.2 million on lobbying this year — triple what it spent in the first half of 2017.
Between April and June this year, PG&E reported spending $1.1 million specifically lobbying on wildfire legislation.
“This is really the biggest issue facing our company today,” said PG&E spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo, adding that PG&E pays for lobbying expenses with shareholder funds, not money from customers.
At issue: Who should be responsible to pay for fire damages? Under existing law, utilities are liable if fires are traced to their equipment — even if there’s no negligence. Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed changing the law to relieve utilities of some liability — protection they desperately want.
Edison, which provides power to much of Southern California, spent $1.3 million lobbying in the first half of this year — double what it spent last year.
Insurance companies are the utilities’ main adversary in this. If utilities become less liable, insurers will have to bear more of the costs from disasters. Insurance trade associations increased their spending on lobbying in the state Capitol by 51 percent this year over last.
There’s a whole lotta wining and dining going on
Most of the money utilities and insurance companies spent on lobbying went to lobbyists, lawyers and publicity campaigns. But the total also includes every cocktail and steak the companies bought for government officials they are trying to influence — nearly $69,000 worth of goodies for the first half of this year.
PG&E treated GOP Sen. Anthony Cannella of Ceres and six of his staff members to a San Francisco Giants game in May. In July, Cannella was appointed to the committee crafting wildfire legislation. He declined to comment for this story.
Overall, PG&E spent more than $3,000 entertaining government officials, including a breakfast in February for Sen. Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat who is co-chair of the wildfire committee, and a  lunch in June for Todd Derum, chief of the Sonoma division of Cal Fire, the agency investigating last year’s fires. Cal Fire has said PG&E’s equipment was involved in 16 fires, and that in 11 of those the company violated state safety codes. Cal Fire has not yet completed its investigation of the deadliest blaze, known as the Tubbs Fire.
Edison spent more than $45,000 entertaining officials. That included a $12,000 reception in January attended by more than 100 legislators and staff members, and a dinner in March at a Los Angeles steakhouse for Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor.
The Personal Insurance Federation of California spent $14,300 entertaining lawmakers and their staff, including an $8,500 reception in March and a $4,000 soiree at a Sacramento nightclub in April. In addition, the trade association treated officials to microbrews, sushi dinners and other goodies, such as a $53 cake for an assemblywoman’s chief of staff.
Rex Frazier, the Personal Insurance Federation lobbyist, said government decisions have a huge impact on the insurance business because it is so highly regulated. “With that,” he said, “comes relationship-building with legislators.”
Victim’s advocacy group funded by lawyers
Fire victims are lobbying to preserve liability laws and pass new rules that could help prevent future wildfires. Their advocacy group Up From the Ashes is represented by a lobbyist who lost his Santa Rosa home in the fires. The group blames PG&E and Edison for not doing enough to prevent last year’s disasters, some of which were sparked by power lines too close to branches and brush.
Up From the Ashes spent about $564,000 lobbying between April and June, with about $55,000 going to a lobbying firm and the rest to a publicity campaign. Where did the money come from? Essentially, law firms involved in lawsuits against utilities.
“We appreciate their funding so we can have a voice,” said Patrick McCallum, the lobbyist for Up From the Ashes, which represents about 600 homeowners, businesses and local governments that lost property in last year’s fires.
Bipartisan love affair
The industries involved in the fight over wildfire legislation aren’t playing favorites: they’ve showered dozens of Republican and Democratic legislators with large campaign contributions and pour huge sums into committees to elect politicians from both parties.
Edison gave $1.1 million to California political campaigns this year, including $250,000 each to the California Democratic Party and the California Republican Party. It also gave $25,000 each to a GOP group called California Trailblazers and the Democratic campaign fighting a senator’s recall. In advance of the June primary, Edison gave $29,200 each to Gavin Newsom and Antonio Villaraigosa, Democratic rivals in the gubernatorial race.
PG&E has given more than $900,000 in political donations this year, including $175,000 to the California Democratic Party and $110,000 to the California Republican Party. It’s also given $25,000 to a committee that supports moderate Republicans and $40,000 to one that supports moderate Democrats.
In addition, PG&E gave $150,000 to a campaign supporting Newsom for governor, and paid nearly $400,000 to a political consulting firm that ran Brown’s campaign for governor and is helping with Newsom’s.
And the Farmers insurance company gave $96,500 to the state GOP and $10,000 each to the California Democratic Party and the Newsom campaign.
Lawmaker doesn’t want PG&E’s money
On June 4, PG&E sent $1,000 to the re-election campaign for Democratic Assemblyman Jim Wood. On June 30, he returned the money.

Wood declined to comment on why he sent back the PG&E money, instead saying through a spokeswoman that he did not solicit the donation.But here’s a clue: he represents parts of Santa Rosa devastated by last year’s fires. Now he sits on the wildfire committee, where he’s questioning whether the Legislature should change liability laws before Cal Fire completes its investigations.

	‘Dancing With the Stars’: Juan Pablo Di Pace scores first 10, Nancy McKeon sent home

		
	Jacquie Oliverius
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 9, 2018 at 7:42 am | UPDATED: October 9, 2018 at 9:36 am

					(ABC/Eric McCandless) VAL CHMERKOVSKIY, NANCY MCKEON
				

Week 3 of Season 27 of “Dancing With the Stars” was “My Most Memorable Year,” when emotions were raw, tears ran freely and tissues were used up by the box.
The rush of emotions, often heart-wrenching, was exacerbated for the pairs by the video that they were told to watch before dancing. In the video, each celeb explained why a particular year was memorable or life-changing.
Perhaps powered in part by their emotions, many of the celebs improved in their performances of previous weeks. In the end, one couple was eliminated after last week’s viewers’ votes were combined with the judges’ scores tonight. Tinashe and Brandon Armstrong, and Nancy McKeon and Val Chmerkovskiy were declared in jeopardy, and sadly, Nancy and Val were sent home. One problem with live shows can be timing and the lack of it, and time ran out before Nancy even got to say goodbye or thank you.


I wondered last week when the first 10 would be given, and I should have put money on Week 3. Juan Pablo Di Pace and Cheryl Burke danced a sexy, sexy samba marking 1999, the year he moved from Buenos Aires. He performed the dance very well, including awesome samba rolls, as the smoke machine filled the ballroom with clouds.
Host Tom Bergeron remarked that the crew didn’t start the smoke machine, but that Juan Pablo and Cheryl started it with their moves! All three judges — Len Goodman,Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba — raved about how well Juan Pablo and Cheryl danced. In fact, Len just stood and applauded, so I knew a 10 was coming. What surprised me was that all three judges scored the dance a 10, giving Juan Pablo and Cheryl the first perfect 30 of the season. It really was a terrific dance, but I’m not convinced it was absolutely perfect and it just wasn’t jaw-dropping for me. Oh well.
My favorite three dances 

1. Milo Manheim is only 17 so he doesn’t have a lot of memorable years to call on, but he and Witney Carson celebrated 2018 (the year his movie came out, he graduated from high school and decides what college to attend) with an amazing jive. It was fast and fun, and at one point, he danced on the judges’ desk and then did a backflip off, without missing a beat. Bruno praised his “strength and elasticity,” and Len said it had “plenty of content, and lovely, sharp flicks and kicks. A terrific jive.” Score: three 9s for 27 out of 30.
2. Bobby Bones has been driving me crazy with his over-the-top moves and lack of determination to stick with the choreography of Sharna Burgess, but he really turned it around this week. The pair did a contemporary routine about 1998, the year he became the first in his family to graduate from high school. He added that before his mom died, she worked to get her GED because he inspired her. He really became emotional and took the dance seriously. Carrie Ann said there were “moments of real magic,’ and Len added that “it was your best dance.” Score: two 8s and a 7 for 23.
3. Brandon Armstrong is in his first season as a pro, after being in the DWTS Troupe, and he is really showing off his choreography ability with Tinashe. The pair performed an amazing rumba that Bruno said was “sensuous, always elegant” and showed “liquid fluidity,” and Len thought it was her best dance. I fully expect the pair to make it to the finals. Score: three 9s for 27.
Uh oh 
1. Once more, Joe Amabile struggled to dance smoothly, no matter how hard his pro partner, Jenna Johnson, works to help him improve. They danced a Viennese waltz, and he is improving, but there is a long way to go for him. The judges used phrases like “you’re still growing” and “you’re a work in progress,” and Bruno said, “(Jenna) got you moving, now you have to work on the quality of movement.” Their scores were all 6s for a total of 18, but even though they were on the bottom of the leaderboard, they still were not “in jeopardy” with a chance of elimination. Sigh …
Next week ought to be fun — it’s “Trios Week” where each couple adds one more pro to perform a routine. Sometimes, this is awesome and sometimes, it is weird. We’ll just need to wait a see. And in two weeks, the world of Disney takes over the ballroom! See you next week — keep dancing!
Scores of celebs & pros:

Juan Pablo & Cheryl: Carrie Ann, 10; Len, 10; Bruno, 10 = 30

Evanna & Keo: 9; 9; 9 = 27

Tinashe & Brandon: 9; 9; 9 = 27

Milo & Witney: 9; 9; 9 = 27

Alexis & Alan: 9; 8; 9 = 26

DeMarcus & Lindsay: 9; 8; 9 = 26

Mary Lou & Sasha: 8; 8; 8 = 24

Bobby & Sharna: 8; 7; 8 = 23

Nancy & Val: 8; 7; 7 = 22 (eliminated)

John & Emma: 7; 7; 7 = 21

Joe & Jenna: 6; 6; 6 = 18

PUBLISHED: March 13, 2018 at 11:30 am | UPDATED: March 13, 2018 at 3:30 pm


MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe has apologized to the company’s movie-going subscribers for comments he made earlier this month about the app tracking users before and after they use it.

Lowe sent an email to subscribers Monday, explaining his comments from a panel talk in Hollywood where he said, “We watch how you drive from home to the movies … we watch where you go afterwards.”

“Through a mix of exuberance about our future and joking around, I mischaracterized how MoviePass locates our members and I need to fix that,” Lowe said Monday. “First and foremost, I apologize for these comments and the concern they caused. At MoviePass, we take customer privacy extremely seriously. I would like to eliminate any misconceptions that we’re collecting location related data.”

At the Entertainment Finance Forum, Lowe — whose talk was titled “Data is the New Oil: How Will MoviePass Monetize It?” — said the company’s app tracking was an integral part of its long-term business plan.

With a monthly plan as low as $7.95 that allows subscribers to see one movie in a partner theater per day, experts and subscribers have raised questions about whether MoviePass can be sustainable in the long run.

Using the data collected from its users, Lowe said MoviePass would like to “build a night at the movies,” where MoviePass can direct subscribers to a dinner place — and get a cut from the vendors.

But Lowe backtracked on the app’s tracking capabilities on Monday, saying MoviePass “does not track and has never tracked or collected data on the location of our members at any point when the app is not active.”

“In our recent update with Apple, we removed the the background tracking capabilities,” said Lowe in the email. “MoviePass does not use and has never used this feature.”

					
				

Lowe said in the email that MoviePass only tracks users in two scenarios: when a user searches for theaters nearby and when a user checks into a theater with the app open.

After Lowe’s comments during the panel discussion were made public, MoviePass issued a statement to this news organization echoing Lowe’s point.

“At MoviePass our vision is to build a complete night out at the movies,” said a MoviePass spokesperson in an emailed statement. “We are exploring utilizing location-based marketing as a way to help enhance the overall experience by creating more opportunities for our subscribers to enjoy all the various elements of a good movie night. We will not be selling the data that we gather. Rather, we will use it to better inform how to market potential customer benefits including discounts on transportation, coupons for nearby restaurants, and other similar opportunities.”

Beyond his location-tracking comments, Lowe exuded optimism about his company’s prospects by the end of 2018. The company has more than 2 million subscribers, and Lowe said he expected to hit 5 million subscribers and account for nearly 20 percent of all U.S. box office ticket purchases by the end of the year.

SAN JOSE — In 2016, San Jose saw a 25-year high in homicides, a distinction that drew a lot of year-end attention. But most experts would agree that a different statistic is more concerning: Violent crime was up across the board, logging a 15 percent increase over last year.

Rapes were up. Robberies were up. And aggravated assaults leapt by nearly one-fifth — suggesting the increase in homicides was no aberration for America’s 10th largest city but part of a violent trend.

“The aggravated assaults are concerning. We can’t solve every homicide, but we know that with more officers, we can saturate hot-spot areas that help bring the temperature down in those areas,” police Chief Eddie Garcia said.

As is the case for the jump in homicides, which hit a year-end total of 47, there are only partial answers for the rise in overall violence. Some observers are chalking it up to an anemic number of officers that hasn’t been this low since the mid-1980s, when the population was 30 percent smaller. Others contend that San Jose has been ensnared in broader unrest that drove a national spike in violent crime, with 16 of the 20 largest cities in the country seeing increases in 2016.

The rise in violent crime threatens to overshadow what have been promising gains in the battle against property crimes, particularly burglaries, that over the past few years have been the most prominent crime trend in San Jose. Mayor Sam Liccardo cautioned the public not to lose sight of what is working.

“Of course we are seriously concerned about the rise in violence we’ve seen in the last year,” Liccardo said, “but this is the wrong time to panic, because against the backdrop of rising violent crime rates across the country, we’re seeing real progress in rebuilding our police department, reducing burglaries and auto thefts, and implementing proven strategies for gang prevention.”

“Our task now,” he added, “is simply to do it all better and faster.”

Aggravated assaults were projected to see a nearly 19 percent jump over 2015, the highest total since 2008. It’s much higher than 2012, the last time violent crime and homicide dominated headlines in San Jose and 46 homicides were recorded, highlighted by a violent August that saw a streak of eight homicides in an 11-day stretch.

The disparity speaks to the relatively fickle dynamic between homicides and violent crime. In 2008, which saw a 10-year high of 2,441 aggravated assaults, there were 33 homicides, a historically moderate number. It illustrates how when assessing homicides, record highs and lows can pivot on fluctuations like a hastily fired bullet beating the odds and hitting its mark, or whether a wounded victim can get to the hospital in time for emergency surgery.

					
				

“That’s a lot of homicides, more than we’d like to see,” Lt. Paul Spagnoli, commander of the San Jose Police Department’s homicide unit, said of the 2016 total. “But it’s a low number for the number of people who are living here.”

Still, Garcia said, the overall crime numbers suggest a need to put more emphasis on crime prevention, and he worries that with current staffing, prioritizing violent crime comes at a cost that could upset one group of residents as they try to help another.

“The byproduct of that is that in areas that are relatively free of violent crime, our officers may not be as visible in those areas,” Garcia said. “But we have to concentrate on areas that are increasingly violent.”

Liccardo said he hopes that a recently passed ballot measure that stabilized police pay and benefits will increase recruitment, which so far has shown modest gains. The city is currently in negotiations over officer pay rates.

In the meantime, the mayor said resources have to be directed to identifiable causes, namely street gangs, and programs such as the San Jose Works program that every summer employs 1,200 teenagers living in gang-affected neighborhoods.

“We need to get to our kids before the gangs do. That’s where we’re going to be focusing our efforts,” Liccardo said. “We have a good sense about what works. We have to focus and bring the entire community to implement these strategies with us.”

Garcia, who aims to helm a rebuilding of the police department after years of understaffing that cut the force by more than a third to about 900 cops, said the scattered motives behind many of the killings and violent attacks remain a formidable challenge.

“On a good number of these homicides, at least a third, we could have 10,000 cops and couldn’t have stopped those,” Garcia said.

Eight homicides have suspected gang motives, three have been attributed to domestic violence — including the 47th, a husband-wife stabbing on Christmas Eve — and eight involved homeless victims, drawing attention to the dangerous reality of living on the streets.

Homicide detectives investigate and gather evidence at the scene of San Jose’s 47th homicide of 2016 on North 10th Street Saturday, Dec. 24, 2016, in San Jose, Calif. A woman was stabbed to death, allegedly at the hands of her husband. (Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group)
Three homicides during the year involved men killing their parents, including an unusual number of patricides, and family ties were present in a handful more. In one instance, a man brutally killed his co-worker with no provocation.

“In regards to what is the trend, what is the particular reason, there really is not one,” Spagnoli said.

The 47 homicides in 2016 represent the city’s high-water mark since 53 were recorded in 1991, which was more pronounced at the time since the population was 20 percent smaller. Since the start of the current decade in 2011, the city has averaged 40 a year, though 2015 saw a five-year low of 30.

Alex Gerould, an assistant professor of criminal justice at San Francisco State University, said the public focus on homicide totals comes from the idea it’s the one crime classification that doesn’t require discretion to classify it.

“It’s the one everyone agrees with, because it’s difficult for police to fudge it,” Gerould said. “But homicide tends to, in most cities, year over year, track its other violent crime.”

While violent crime is trending up in San Jose, property crimes are continuing a downward trajectory since a 10-year peak in 2012, though the current levels are still elevated compared to the 2000s, when the city enjoyed status as the safest large city in the United States.

San Jose police have made a particularly pronounced dent in burglaries, projected to drop by 16 percent from last year. Part of that can be attributed to a tireless SJPD burglary unit, which has broken up multiple burglary crews that account for the majority of residential break-ins in the city. An increase in the affordability of home-surveillance cameras has made residents a vital part of that effort.

The August bust of an East Palo Alto gang-based crew, according to police estimates, drove a 50 percent drop in burglaries in the Evergreen area alone.

“A hundred different burglaries aren’t committed by 100 different people,” Garcia said. “You arrest one burglar, you’re going to solve numerous others.”

Greg Woods, a criminal justice lecturer at San Jose State University, said residents banding together to pool their observations, whether it’s for a burglary or something else, is one key to staying safe as the police department rebuilds and even after.

“The best thing you can do is be aware of your environment. Introduce yourself to your neighbors, know who is patrolling your neighborhood,” Woods said. “Familiarize yourself with what’s going on outside. That way, if people who are criminally minded come to your safe zone, you’re more likely to identify criminal behavior and report it to authorities.”

Garcia has plans to create a proactive burglary-prevention unit once staffing allows. But he also acknowledges that the department will have to limit its points of focus until more help arrives.

“Our two main objectives are burglaries in the daytime and aggravated assaults in the evening,” he said. “We have to triage what’s important in the city. We’re playing five-man baseball. There are going to be hits going the opposite way, and we can’t control that.”

But Garcia also knows that everything is relative when it comes to crime, particularly in a city that is predominantly suburban.

“San Jose is a very safe city,” he said. “But it hasn’t been easy, and it’s been on the backs of a tired and depleted workforce. We’re doing all we can do right now.”

			Hanson: Trump’s crude to reporters, but journalists aren’t innocent		

	
	

Journalists from Christiane Amanpour to Jorge Ramos say that neutral reporting rules do not always apply to Trump.

						CNN anchor Anderson Cooper was forced to apologize after he crudely trashed a pro-Trump panelist, saying, “If he took a dump on his desk, you would defend it!”		
	
By Victor Davis Hanson | 
PUBLISHED: August 9, 2018 at 12:45 pm | UPDATED: August 10, 2018 at 4:26 am


The media are furious that President Trump serially decries “fake news.” He often rants that journalists who traffic in it are “enemies of the people.”

Reporters have compared Trump to mass murderers such as Stalin and Hitler because of his dislike of the press.

Trump may be crude to reporters, but journalists are also not so innocent. They have brought much of the present calumny upon themselves in a variety of ways.

The media seem to have little concern that their coverage is biased even though polls show that the vast majority of Americans believe the media intentionally reports fake news.

Indeed, fake news is not a Trump exaggeration. Despite coverage to the contrary, Trump did not remove a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. Testimony by former FBI Director James Comey revealed that senior Trump campaign officials did not consult “senior Russian intelligence officials,” as the New York Times reported. Putin denied having compromising information on Trump during an NBC interview after an earlier NBC report said Putin did not deny having such information.

Despite hysterical reports that in testimony before Congress, Comey would refute Trump’s claim that Comey had assured him he was not under investigation, Comey instead confirmed Trump’s story.

The list of such false news reports is long. The common theme is that even recklessly derogatory news is seen by many as serving the higher purpose of delegitimizing the Trump presidency.

Auditing coverage of the first 100 days of the Trump presidency, the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy found that of the news reports with a clear tone, 80 percent of the stories about Trump were negative, 20 percent positive.

					
				

Journalists ranging from Christiane Amanpour to Jorge Ramos to Jim Rutenberg have argued that the rules of neutral reportage should no longer necessarily apply when it comes to Trump.

The WikiLeaks email trove of correspondence between Hillary Clinton and her campaign adviser, John Podesta, revealed that marquee journalists were colluding with Clinton aides to ensure the right spin was put on stories before publication. CNN analyst Donna Brazile leaked debate questions to Clinton in advance.

Too often, reporters smear the president in the crudest possible ways.

Politico’s Julia Ioffe suggested that Trump might have engaged in incest with his daughter.

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper was forced to apologize after he crudely trashed a pro-Trump panelist, saying, “If he took a dump on his desk, you would defend it!”

This year’s White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner turned into a Trump hatefest, as host Michelle Wolf savagely trashed the president. Wolf even mocked the looks of White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.

The late CNN host Anthony Bourdain once joked about poisoning Trump. Religious scholar Reza Aslan referred to Trump as “this piece of s–t.”

Sometimes journalists disparage and stereotype Trump supporters. Recently, Politico reporter Marc Caputo tweeted of the crowd he saw at a Trump rally: “If you put everyone’s mouths together in this video, you’d get a full set of teeth.” Then he doubled down by calling them “garbage people.”

The New York Times knew when it newly hired tech writer Sarah Jeong as an editorial board member that she had a history of crude, racist tweets, some directed at Trump.

Is this war between Trump and the media unprecedented?

Not quite.

So far, Trump’s attacks are verbal, and subject to public debate. Unlike his predecessors, he has not yet secretly weaponized the government to spy on and harass journalists he doesn’t like.

Reporters loved Barack Obama. But his Justice Department improperly and secretly surveilled Associated Press reporters and monitored the phone calls and emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

President John Adams in 1798 pushed through Sedition Act, barring journalistic criticism of the government.

Woodrow Wilson systematically had reports censored that he felt were critical of his wartime administration. His state-run propaganda machine, the “Committee on Public Information,” had a creepy French Revolutionary ring to it.

Liberal icon Franklin D. Roosevelt makes Trump’s bluster about the media look relatively amateurish. FDR used the Federal Communications Commission to stifle critical news. Roosevelt’s congressional allies tried to push through a “libel bill” to criminalize hostile reporting. At a press conference in the middle of World War II, Roosevelt once handed a reporter a Nazi Iron Cross and told him that another journalist whom FDR hated had earned it.

John F. Kennedy had the CIA wiretap two Washington reporters.

There is no doubt that Trump should ease off his blanket condemnations of the journalists and their profession. But for their part, reporters have to stop creating news where there is none. And they should refrain from personal attacks on the president and his family, and from stereotyping Trump supporters as garbage.

In the meantime, we should remember that the real danger to a free press is not loud public bluster from a perceived hostile president. More often, First Amendment threats come from the quiet weaponization of the government against journalists — which, ironically, is sometimes orchestrated by presidents who are beloved press idols.

			Opinion: Canada’s tar sands pipeline plan threatens Bay Area		

	
	

The threat to San Francisco Bay from the proposed Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion is tangible and toxic

						Birds in 2007 fly over Crissy Field East Beach in San Francisco, which was closed for oil clean up after the cargo ship Cosco Busan struck one of four supports beneath the western span of the Bay Bridge.		
	
By Matt Krogh | 
PUBLISHED: October 5, 2018 at 6:45 am | UPDATED: October 5, 2018 at 6:58 am


A proposed expansion of a tar sands oil pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia has erupted into the largest controversy Canada has seen in years. The project’s proponents want to increase production and export of tar sands for world markets, including — even featuring — California.

It raises the question: Could the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion lead to Canada’s tar sands oil poisoning the Bay Area? The answer is yes.

Tar sands is one of the dirtiest crude oils on the planet. It’s high in sulfur and heavy metals. Extracting and refining it creates an outsize climate impact. Tar sands is so thick when it comes out of the ground that it can only be moved through a pipeline after dilution with toxic chemicals.

These same toxic chemicals also make it unsafe to approach a tar sands spill until the chemicals have evaporated. This means that in the event of a spill in San Francisco Bay, the heavy portions of tar sands will have the chance to sink while first-responders wait for the toxic, and explosive, chemicals to disperse. And with high amounts of sulfur present in tar sands, the chances increase for a refinery explosion like the 2012 disaster at Chevron in Richmond.

It’s ironic that even while Californians, including climate-conscious Bay Area residents, lead the country in getting off oil, those same communities may well be exposed to increased risks from the transport and refining of tar sands.

Bay Area residents are no stranger to refinery emissions and explosions, or to oil spills like Phillips 66’s in the Carquinez Strait in 2016 and the Cosco Busan disaster in 2007. A major spill of tar sands could be much worse.

A 2014 study of the economic impacts of an oil spill in Washington’s Puget Sound estimated that a major spill of conventional floating crude oil could cost the state 165,000 jobs and $10.8 billion in annual economic activity. What would a similar size spill of an even more difficult to clean up crude like tar sands mean for San Francisco Bay?

It’s true that Canada has shipped crude oil to California for years. According to a 2018 Greenpeace report, over the last five years, two-thirds of tankers loaded with crude oil from the existing Trans Mountain pipeline went to California. But that was only a few dozen tankers a year. If the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is built, seven times more tankers would depart from British Columbia. Most of those tankers would be carrying tar sands, and many would be headed to refineries in the Bay Area and Long Beach.

Bay Area residents need to take notice because this is not an abstract threat: Phillips 66’s San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo is seeking permits to bring in and refine more heavy crude oil like tar sands. The refinery is working to expand its ability to process heavy crude oil, and to more than double the number of tankers allowed at its marine terminal — all in anticipation of the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion.

					
				

Communities up and down the West Coast have successfully fought dozens of fossil fuel expansion proposals, from oil train terminals proposed in Benicia, San Luis Obispo and Pittsburg, to North America’s two largest coal terminals proposed in Washington state.

Phillips 66 doesn’t yet have all the permits it needs to be able to process more tar sands and bring in more tankers. The public has a say in the permitting process for the Rodeo refinery’s proposal to more than double the number of tankers it receives, with a draft environmental review likely open for public comment in early 2019.

The threats to Bay Area residents from Canada’s proposed Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion are tangible and toxic. They must say no to any more expansion of the fossil fuel industry, starting with Phillips 66’s refinery expansion in Rodeo.

	ESPN announcer Mark Jones’ tweet about Washington called “childish” … by an ESPN executive

		
	Jon Wilner
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 10, 2018 at 1:25 pm | UPDATED: September 11, 2018 at 12:49 pm

	Washington was none too pleased about a sarcastic tweet from ESPN announcer Mark Jones following the Huskies’ loss to Auburn.
Nor was the Pac-12.
Nor, it seems, was Jones’ employer.


“Childish behavior that is unacceptable,” an ESPN executive wrote to UW athletic director Jen Cohen in an email obtained by the Hotline via a public records request.
Nick Dawson, ESPN’s vice president for programming and acquisitions, also told Cohen that “we will also ensure that Mark is not assigned to any further Washington games.”
Dawson did not specify how long the ban would be in place.
The day after Washington’s 21-16 loss to Auburn — a high-stakes game in the heart of SEC country (Atlanta) — Jones, who was not part of the broadcast crew, took to Twitter:
“Washington Huskies took one one on the chin. Where’s Montana ?”
Jones was heavily criticized for lack of professionalism while calling a UW game last season.
That broadcast featured ESPN sideline reporter Quint Kessenich placing cupcakes on the sideline to mock the Huskies’ soft schedule — it included Montana — and Jones, the play-by-play announcer, describing coach Chris Petersen as “somewhat cantankerous.”
(Petersen, in keeping with his policy, had declined to meet with the ESPN crew before the game.)
Dawson’s email to Cohen was sent Sept. 3, the day after Jones’ tweet. He copied Pac-12 deputy commissioner Jamie Zaninovich and two senior ESPN officials, Lee Fitting and Pete Derzis.
“Frustrating and disappointing to us on so many levels,” Dawson wrote.
He noted the “positive interactions” the ABC broadcast crew had with Washington’s staff during the weekend of the Auburn game:
“A great example of how the partnership can/should work on both sides.”
The significance of that line should not be overlooked.

Jones’ tweet was the fourth instance in the past 11 months of ESPN broadcasters taking public jabs at Washington or the Pac-12, which has a 12-year, $3 billion partnership with ESPN and Fox.
The barbs were enough that Pac-12 officials and head coaches had open discussions with ESPN executives and on-air talent during the conference’s spring meetings.
The goal: Improving ESPN’s promotion of the Pac-12 and identifying ways the conference could support that endeavor.
(As the Hotline noted last week, the relationship is vital to the conference over the long haul.)

The good vibes continued through the summer, when athletic communication strategists from several schools joined Stanford coach David Shaw in Bristol to meet with ESPN executives, producers and talent.
Then, less than 24 hours after the first game of the season, Jones fired off his tweet.
Neither ESPN or the Pac-12 would comment on the matter at the time, other than to say it was being addressed.
Once Washington learned of the tweet, Cohen sent an email to Zaninovich saying, “we are all at a loss for how to work with mark.”
Zaninovich responded to Cohen that “at a loss” was “the right phrase” and took the matter to Dawson, describing the behavior as “bizarre” in his email.
In his response to Cohen and Zaninovich, Dawson noted that Fitting, the vice president for college sports, was handling the situation “directly” with Jones.

“It did not leak from us.”
— U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, denying suggestions in last week’s judiciary committee hearing that her office leaked the identity of a Palo Alto woman who told her Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school but who also requested confidentiality.

						Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul grabs his right hamstring after falling to the floor in the final minute of Game 5. (AP Photo/David J. Phillip)		
	
By Bud Geracie | bgeracie@bayareanewsgroup.com | 
PUBLISHED: May 27, 2018 at 12:12 pm | UPDATED: May 27, 2018 at 1:26 pm


Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul is “less than likely” to play in Game 7 against the Golden State Warriors, according to a report. 

ESPN, citing undientified sources, said Paul is “less likely than likely, but working every angle to try” to get back on the court.

Paul, 33, suffered an injury to his right hamstring in the final minute of Game 5, a game in which he willed his team to victory and a 3-2 series lead over the favored Warriors. Paul, whose career has been cursed by untimely injuries, has never advanced this far in the playoffs in his 13 years with New Orleans, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Rockets. 
This is the play on which Chris Paul was injured. Quinn Cook is defending. (Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group) 

He traveled with the Rockets for Game 6 in Oakland, although coach Mike D’Antoni said there was “no shot” Paul would play. Instead, Paul, dressed in team warmups, prowled the sidelines like a coach, exhorting the players and working the refs. 

As Game 7 approaches, memories are stirring of Willis Reed’s heroic efforts in the deciding game of the 1970 finals between the New York Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers. Reed, the Knicks center, had sustained a major injury in Game 5, a torn thigh muscle that kept him out of Game 6. He was expected to miss Game 7 as well, but when the Knicks came out for warmups, their captain was with them.. 

His thigh heavily wrapped, Reed scored the first two baskets of the game for the Knicks. He did not score again, limping through 27 minutes, but his courageous performance inspired the Madison Square Garden crowd and helped the Knicks to a 113-99 victory. 

Ah, but those were different times. The NBA was a different game, slower and more stationary.

A better comparison for today would be Game 3 of the 1989 NBA Finals. That’s the one Magic Johnson tried to play after pulling his hamstring the previous game. He lasted five minutes and the Lakers went down in four games to the Bad Boy Detroit Pistons. 

					
				

My guess for Monday night: Paul tries to play, but can’t.

By Nate Gartrell | ngartrell@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: October 1, 2018 at 9:39 am | UPDATED: October 1, 2018 at 3:53 pm


MARTINEZ — Contra Costa County prosecutors filed a 12-count criminal complaint against a Walnut Creek private school groundskeeper, which accuses him of molesting a girl over a six-year period.

The Contra Costa Sheriff’s office released this image Tuesday, Sept. 25, 2018 of Enrique Pina, 71, of Walnut Creek, Calif. (Courtesy Contra Costa Sheriff’s Office) 
Enrique Pina, 71, was charged with forcible lewd act on a child, forcible oral copulation, forcible sodomy and related charges. Some of the charges allege the victim was younger than 10 years old at the time.

If found guilty on all counts, Pina could be sentenced to more than 150 years to life in prison. He remains in custody in lieu of $9.6 million bail, according to jail records.

Pina was an employee at the Palmer School, located at 2740 Jones Road in Walnut Creek. Authorities say the victim was not tied to the school. When Pina was arrested last week, school officials released a statement saying he had been “removed from his duties and barred from the campus while the sheriff’s office and district attorney review the allegations.”

Police started investigating the case after the girl — referred to as “Jane Doe” in court records —  came forward alleging that Pina had molested her for years. In addition to the ongoing molestation, Pina allegedly showed the girl pornography.

During the investigation, police say Pina confessed to some of the conduct and made sexually graphic remarks about the girl.

Anyone with information in this case can to call the sheriff’s office investigative division at 925-313-2600, call 866-846-3592 to leave an anonymous voicemail or email tips@so.cccounty.us.

PUBLISHED: October 8, 2018 at 10:37 pm | UPDATED: October 8, 2018 at 10:43 pm


SAN MATEO — A trio of armed robbers shocked a man with a stun gun during an attempted robbery at a business in San Mateo early Monday morning, according to police.

The incident was reported about 4:50 a.m. at a “secured business” on the 1800 block of South Norfolk Street.



In a news release, San Mateo police said the three suspects forced their way inside the business and shocked a man with a stun gun, causing him to hit his head.

Officers asked residents to shelter in place while they searched the area for the suspects. No suspects were found, but detectives are reviewing surveillance footage and interviewing witnesses, according to police.

A second victim was found at Monterey Road and Spring Street, police said. He had been stabbed in the stomach and arm.

Officers were providing first aid to the victims when they found a third man with stab wounds to his back.

The victims were taken to trauma centers to be treated for their injuries, according to police. As of Monday afternoon, one had been released from the hospital and the others were recovering.

An officer who went to the stabbing scene noticed two women who appeared to be trying to hide near Monterey Road and Dunne Avenue. Officers made contact with them and allegedly found a bloody knife on one.

The women were identified as Tori Sanchez, 22, of Freedom, and Alexandria Campos, 23, of Morgan Hill. Both were arrested and booked into Santa Clara County Jail on charges of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, according to police.

By Nate Gartrell | ngartrell@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: October 3, 2018 at 1:06 pm | UPDATED: October 8, 2018 at 4:29 pm


SAN PABLO — Police have identified the Oakley man who fatally shot himself during a routine traffic stop last month, in an incident still shrouded in mystery.

Marcus Lamont Bray, 41, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sept. 28, as he was being pulled over by a San Pablo officer. Police say they are still investigating whether it was a suicide or an accident.

“This incident is frustrating, and tragic for the family. They’re confused as well,” San Pablo police Lt. Brian Bubar said. “We’re working with the family and doing what we can to provide answers.”

But, Bubar added, “so far we still don’t know exactly why it happened.”

Court records show Bray had a warrant for his arrest in Santa Clara County. It was related to a grand theft charge that was filed in February, and alleged a violation in October 2017.

Around noon Sept. 28, in the 1400 block of Contra Costa Avenue, a San Pablo officer saw Bray driving a car with license plates that matched a different vehicle. As the officer was getting out of the car to approach Bray, he heard gunshots, according to a police news release.

The car Bray was driving then lurched forward, crashed into two parked cars and stopped. A gun registered to Bray — believed to be the weapon used in the shooting — was later found in the car, police said.

Because Bray died while police were pulling him over, authorities invoked Contra Costa County’s protocol for deaths where an officer is involved. That means the Contra Costa County District Attorney will conduct an investigation.

In coming months, the county coroner will hold an inquest into Bray’s death, which typically includes testimony from the officers involved. During inquest hearings, jurors are asked to pick a cause of death from four choices, in a decision that carries no civil nor criminal liability. The hearings typically take months to schedule.

					
				

Police ask anyone with information to contact the San Pablo Police Department at 510-215-3150 or the West Contra Costa Crime Stoppers Tip Line at 510-799-8255.

PUBLISHED: May 16, 2018 at 10:52 am | UPDATED: May 16, 2018 at 3:28 pm


A South San Francisco teacher charged with molesting four students during school hours had been previously warned by Westborough Middle School administrators to “not touch or put arms around students,” according to prosecutors.

The exact nature of the behavior displayed by Westborough teacher Joseph Toy that led to a warning by school administrators before any police investigation was not provided by the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office.

“They felt he was being too touchy,” San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said, adding the interactions were not viewed by the school administrators as “criminal.”

Following the initial warning, the date of which was not disclosed by the district attorney’s office or by the South San Francisco School District, Westborough officials called police on April 25 to report Toy was engaging in “inappropriate interactions” with students, information that resulted in Toy’s arrest May 10.

Prosecutors said Toy was previously told by school administrators to not touch students “based on some complaints,” but did not specify when the warning was given. The school district did not respond to questions regarding the warning given to Toy.

Joseph Toy, 39, a middle school teacher in South San Francisco, has been charged with 47 counts, including 30 charges of lewd and lascivious acts with a child, stemming from allegations of inappropriately touching four boys ages 13 and 14. 
Toy, 39, of San Bruno, was formally arraigned in court Monday and charged with 47 criminal counts, including 30 charges of lewd and lascivious acts with a child, stemming from allegations of inappropriately touching four boys ages 13 and 14, according to the district attorney’s office.

Toy, who taught at Westborough Middle School for about 13 years, remains in custody on $5.2 million bail and could face life in prison if convicted as charged, prosecutors said. The San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office released Toy’s booking mugshot Wednesday.

Prosecutors allege Toy sexually molested four male students over the course of 11 months, either on school grounds, in his classroom or in a hotel during a school trip to Disneyland in April.

Three of the victims were allegedly touched while they were 13 and 14, according to prosecutors. The fourth student was 14 when the alleged molestation occurred. Prosecutors say the improper touching included picking the boys up by their armpits, putting them on his lap and kissing them on the back of the neck and head. Toy is also accused of putting his hand underneath their shirts to touch their bare stomachs and chests.

					
				

One of the boys mentioned the behavior to a teacher, who notified school administrators, according to prosecutors. School officials called police April 25, who launched an investigation that same day.

“We followed our discipline policies when we first became aware that this individual violated our professional standards,” district spokesperson Ryan Sebers said in an email. “He was warned to stop breaching appropriate boundaries with student contact. He was disciplined to the full extent of our policies. If these allegations prove to be true, he violated our rules and our trust despite our early intervention and direct warnings.

 

On the home page of the school district’s website, Superintendent Shawnterra Moore addressed the arrest and wrote that Toy was placed on on administrative before criminal charges were filed.

“The teacher remains on administrative leave and will no longer be on any of our campuses pending the outcome of this case,” Moore wrote. “District and school leaders are cooperating closely with SSFPD officers as they continue their criminal investigation.”

More details are emerging for San Jose native Kerri Walsh Jennings’ inaugural beach volleyball/wellness/concert tour coming to Avaya Stadium in San Jose next month.
The p1440 event will feature a men’s and women’s beach volleyball tournament, along with a village devoted to health, fitness and wellness issues, as well as a music stage.
On Thursday, Jennings and p1440 organizers announced a music lineup that includes Foster the People, Grouplove, Daya, Marian Hill and Magic Giant.


The three-time Olympic gold medalist and professional volleyball player, who graduated from Stanford University and San Jose-Archbishop Mitty High School, earlier this year announced the creation of the p1440 tour, so-named because of its theme of spending all 1,440 minutes of the day with a purpose.
Jennings co-founded the tour after splitting from the Association of Volleyball Professionals, reportedly because she had different concepts for staging and marketing beach volleyball. The tour she has co-founders have created is a mix of spectator sport, lifestyle event and pop music concert. Or, as she put it in a press release:
“We want people to come to our event, watch the best of the best in beach volleyball compete for the title, learn and engage with our p1440 experts and partners, immerse themselves in our health and wellness village, enjoy chart-topping musical acts and leave inspired and empowered to live the p1440 lifestyle well beyond our events. We want people to go on an adventure with us and leave ‘better’ for it.”
The event runs Sept. 28-30 at the grounds at Avaya Stadium, home of the San Jose Earthquakes soccer team. The exact schedule for the musical acts has not been disclosed yet.
Headliners Foster the People is a Los Angeles indie-pop outfit best known for the 2010 hit “Pumped Up Kicks” as well as for the current hit “Sit Next to Me.”
Tickets for the event went on sale 10 a.m. Aug. 2. Weekend passes start at $80 for adults, $40 kids under age 12); www.p1440.com.
The San Jose event kicks off p1440’s inaugural 2018-19 season. Other events are set for Las Vegas, San Diego and Huntington Beach in 2018, with four more to come in 2019 during this first season. But Jennings was sure to start things off in her native San Jose.

	Peralta Community College district: State elections complaint filed against trustee running for re-election

		
	Thomas Peele and David DeBolt
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 15, 2018 at 6:00 am | UPDATED: September 17, 2018 at 7:51 pm

	  
		Categories:
		California News, News, Politics	



	OAKLAND — A complaint lodged with the state Fair Political Practices Commission alleges that Peralta Community College District Trustee Linda Handy violated campaign finance laws by not repaying loans from a political consultant and keeping inaccurate campaign finance records.
The consultant, Kathy Neal, is a former Oakland port commissioner and ex-wife of former Oakland Mayor and state Assemblyman Elihu Harris. The district has paid Neal more than $308,000 over the past decade for helping market projects included in a bond passed by voters in 2006. Harris was Peralta’s chancellor but left the district in 2010.
A Peralta history professor, Blake Johnson, filed the complaint with the commission, which enforces campaign fiance laws, last month. It alleges Handy made incomplete and inaccurate campaign finance reports, didn’t keep accurate records, violated contribution rules and has a conflict of interest because of Neal’s work for the district.


Johnson said he is hoping to draw attention and reforms to the institutional culture at the district that he has dubbed “the Peralta Way.” He defined it as “a not-so-humorous reference to Peralta’s history of not paying attention to problems, ignoring self-dealing and corruption, and general administrative churn and incompetence.”
Campaign finance records from 2008, the oldest available, show Handy had an outstanding debt of $7,500. It doesn’t say who loaned her the money. In 2010 campaign finance reports, Handy reported she owed Neal’s company, Kneal Resource System, $7,500, and doesn’t report retiring any of the 2008 debt. Handy reported receiving a new $7,500 loan from Neal’s company in 2015, bringing to $15,500 the total debt owed  the consultant. That outstanding debt was reported on campaign finance reports filed in June of this year, but did not report to whom it was owed. There is no record of repayments.
Neal has done political work for both Handy and Peralta Trustee William Riley. Both are seeking re-election in the November election.
Neither Handy or Neal returned repeated messages Thursday and Friday.
Kathy Neal is a consultant for the Peralta Community College District.<br />(Staff archives) Central to the matter is Neal’s long term-work for the district. Neal is a long-time political operative in Oakland, and a former Port commissioner. In 2012, she sought the Democratic nomination for the 18th State Assembly District but withdrew before the primary election.
The FPPC complaint comes as the district has both an $800 million bond measure and a parcel tax extension on the November ballot. The former chair of the district’s citizens bond oversight committee wrote a ballot argument against the parcel tax over questions how the previous parcel tax monies had been used, and the bond rating firm Moody’s downgraded the district’s financial status to negative in August, citing weak fiscal management.
The district consists of four colleges, Laney and Merritt in Oakland, The College of Alameda and Berkeley City College. Voters in Albany, Piedmont, Emeryville, Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda elect its trustees.
Records show Neal began working for Peralta in 2008 when her ex-husband, Harris, was the district’s chancellor. She was paid a little more than $67,000 that year, most of it from construction bond money that voters approved in 2006, according to records released by Chancellor Jowel Laguerre on Friday.
Between 2009 and 2017, she was paid another $241,000, most of it for “education and outreach” involving the 2006 bond, Measure A. All of it came it came in small payments that didn’t require board approval.
But it was not clear Friday when a contract for Neal’s decade of work was approved. Vice Chancellor Sadiq Ikharo, who was in charge of the distribution of Measure A money until a recent job change, said he didn’t know when Neal was hired.
“That would involve research, it could be in a box someplace,” he said Friday before ending the call.  A current and former board member said they couldn’t recall voting on any contracts in recent years.
An assistant to Laguerre said no one was available to look for contracts on Friday.
Harris said in a telephone interview Friday that Neal was doing work for the district before he became chancellor in 2003. “She was there prior to me,” he said. Eventually she was “working on newsletters” highlighting projects paid for through the 2006 bond.
A district trustee who is often a critic of Peralta administration ripped the lack of transparency over how Neal was paid.
“There is just too much that stinks here and the pattern of behavior, the clubby connections among all of these inside players, the payments that fly under the radar— it’s just too much to be all above-board,” Trustee Nicky Gonzalez Yuen said. “We need some sunshine here to make them explain what they have been doing. I just do not see this board or administration making this happen”.
Neal is also a member and officer of the Alameda County Central Democratic Committee, which is scheduled to vote Saturday on endorsements in the November Peralta trustees election.
Because of her past work for Handy and Riley – and the money Handy lists as owing her – Johnson and Gonzalez Yuen have asked for Neal to be recused from Peralta endorsements.
“When I cast a vote, I must both declare any material conflicts of interest I may have and then recuse myself from any consideration in the matter. As a Democrat, I want my Party to have ethical standards that are at least this high.” Gonzalez Yuen wrote in an email. He is backing Riley and Handy’s opponents.  “So, I find it deeply troubling that this significant conflict of interest has never been declared.”

Committee chairperson Robin Torello scoffed at the idea of Neal recusing herself from the endorsements.
“Nobody ever gets recused,” Torello said. “If you recused the committee (members) on anything you’d have to recuse the whole committee.”

						California’s WARN Act applies to employers who are laying off 50 or more employees at one location. Tesla has sales and service centers across the state, so the WARN notices for Fremont and Palo Alto are not an exhaustive list.		
	
By Bloomberg | 
June 18, 2018 at 8:39 pm


(Bloomberg) — Tesla filed notices with its home state that shed light on which workers are being dismissed from several key California facilities as part of Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s profit-motivated reorganization.

In letters to state and local officials, Tesla said it will part with at least 420 employees in Fremont, where it has its vehicle assembly plant, as well as 86 workers at its Palo Alto headquarters. The most common roles being cut are process technicians in Fremont and mechanical design engineers in Palo Alto, though the company lists dozens of different job titles in each notice.

It’s unclear whether these are the first of several notices Tesla is filing with the state under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, known as WARN. The California Development Department and a company spokesman both declined to comment beyond the notices, which are dated Friday.

Musk, 46, announced last week that Tesla would let go of 9 percent of employees across the company. He said the cuts would almost entirely affect salaried workers and wouldn’t affect the carmaker’s ability to meet production targets for its Model 3 sedan.

California’s WARN Act applies to employers who are laying off 50 or more employees at one location. Tesla has sales and service centers across the state, so the WARN notices for Fremont and Palo Alto are not an exhaustive list.

	Podcast: Targeting talk with Pac-12 Networks and Fox analyst Evan Moore (a good rule inconsistently applied)

		
	Jon Wilner
	  
	PUBLISHED: October 4, 2018 at 6:30 am | UPDATED: October 4, 2018 at 6:32 am

	Pac-12 football in September:
Chaos in the South, injured stars, perfection by the Flatirons, losses on the big stage, a knee not taken, winless in Westwood … and targeting.
The rule and its inconsistent application have impacted games of all types — momentous and routine, conference and non-conference, home and road and neutral — and done so on a weekly basis.


Targeting has been a dominant theme of the first month, frustrating players and coaches, inciting fans, baffling media and embroiling a commissioner who dared weigh in.
The Jake Browning non-call against Auburn.

The Utah ejections (Leki Fotu, Marquise Blair) against Washington.

The Arizona State end-game (Frank Darby) against San Diego State.

The Porter Gustin hit on Gardner Minshew.
And we still have two-thirds of the season to play.
Something must change to prevent targeting from taking the remainder of the Pac-12 season hostage. What that is, I’m not sure.
Actually, I am sure:
Officials in the replay booths across the conference and in the command center in San Francisco must get the calls right, even if that means delaying a game three minutes … five minutes … 10 minutes.
Of course, getting it right in the booth is easier typed than done.
To help sort through the rule and everything it entails, the Hotline asked Evan Moore, the Pac-12 Networks and Fox analyst who played five years in the NFL, to join me for a podcast.
Moore has a deep understanding of targeting, far deeper than yours truly.
He spent 25 minutes methodically explaining the rule in a manner that’s easy to understand, even if you don’t have images on the screen in front of you.
And yes, he voiced an opinion on several specific calls.
On the Browning non-call:
“The most baffling one of the year, without question. He lowered his head before attacking. I don’t even need to see another angle.”
On the Gustin-Minshew non-call:
“The most troubling thing I had when watching that play was … (why) they didn’t just take a longer look at it.”
Now, a word of warning:
If you’re interested in a rational, insightful conversation about the targeting rule — its intent, application and flaws — then this podcast is for you.
If you’re looking for blood-spitting outrage and unhinged criticism of Pac-12 officiating, it’s probably not for you.

Moore’s goal, which I wholeheartedly supported, was to provide clarity for confused fans.
No doubt, it’s a complicated rule … a complicated rule with commendable intent and significant consequences: The punishment is disqualification, not 10-yards-and-replay-the-down.
Oh, and I should mention: We also talked a little football.
I asked Moore to address a few notable developments from September.
He mentioned (in detail) the South race, Stanford’s stagnant running game, the impact of quarterback play across the conference and a few other issues.
He also offered his picks for the division races.
Please enjoy the podcast. And if, after listening, you’re still confused, email me at the address below and I’ll attempt to get an answer.

			Editorial: Prop. 72 rewards homeowners for conserving water		

	
	

Ballot measure would shield property owners from tax increases for rainwater capture systems.

							(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group)

						Judy Adler of Walnut Creek was the inspiration for Proposition 72 after telling state Sen. Steve Glazer that California should provide incentives for purchasing the kind of rainwater capture systems she built on her property.		
	
By Mercury News & East Bay Times Editorial Boards | 
PUBLISHED: March 13, 2018 at 6:15 am | UPDATED: May 3, 2018 at 9:24 am


Rather than letting rain falling on the roof run off into gutters and storm drains, the water could be used to irrigate yards. But homeowners are currently penalized with higher property taxes if they install systems to capture the rainwater.

That would change if voters pass Proposition 72 on the June 5 ballot. The measure, which deserves support, would exclude rainwater capture systems from tax assessments, giving property owners a needed incentive to help the state meet its water conservation goals.

California voters approved similar measures in the 1980s and 1990s to support installation of solar panels, upgrades for people with disabilities and fire sprinklers. The author of Prop. 72, state Sen. Steve Glazer, D-Orinda, hopes it will make rainwater capture as popular as solar installation. That’s a lofty goal. But any sensible effort to combat drought deserves support. Prop. 72 meets that standard.

Glazer introduced SB 558 in the Legislature last fall, hoping it would win sufficient backing to put it before voters, as required by state law. In a rare show of bipartisan support, the bill was passed 76-0 in the Assembly and 39-0 in the state Senate and was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in January.  Prop. 72 has no organized opposition, and environmental groups, business groups and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association have gotten behind the ballot measure.

Rainwater capture systems are not cheap. A tank capable of storing 5,000 gallons of water costs between $2,500-$5,000, depending on whether it is made of plastic or steel. Those costs may come down if more people install tanks on their property.
A home with a 1,500-square-foot roof is capable of collecting 10,000 gallons of water in an area that gets 12 inches of rain a year. San Jose, for example, averages 15 inches of rain a typical year, while Walnut Creek gets 23 inches.

The rainfall that is captured can’t be used for drinking. But it is suitable for watering gardens and landscaping and for filling ponds.

Glazer notes that Australia has had great success with offering rainfall capture incentives. Nearly a third of Australian homes have installed systems.

					
				

The impetus for the California legislation came from a community meeting. A Walnut Creek resident had installed four rainwater capture tanks and told Glazer that she thought more property owners would do the same if provided with greater incentives.

“I worked hard to simplify this legislation,” said Glazer. “But in its simplest form it’s designed to provide the same kind of tax incentives that we have with electric cars and solar energy. It could also inspire developers to install systems when building new homes.”

Californians have demonstrated the ability to be conservation-minded citizens when given the opportunity. Proposition 72 eliminates a tax penalty for home owners trying to help the state conserve water. Vote yes on June 5.

PITTSBURG — A man shot to death in the city’s second homicide of the year has been identified by authorities.

Jjuan Sanders, 38, of Pittsburg, died at a hospital Saturday morning after being shot at least one time, police said. Officers found him after responding to the 600 block of Cumberland Street around 2 a.m.

Detectives continued to investigate Monday. Police have not identified a suspect but have said the Sanders and his shooter knew each other.

Investigators have interviewed patrons at a nearby business, and reviewed video surveillance, police said.

The city’s only other homicide happened in July.

Wine-tasting rooms and cozy cafes line the lanes of Sutter Creek, the Sierra foothills town whose covered sidewalks and historic storefronts almost feel frozen in time. But there are always new treasures to find as we return each year.

On this particular weekend, we’ve set out from the Hanford House Inn, a sleek B&B perched on Old Highway 49, to explore. Two new wine tasting rooms, Matthew Gibson and 1850, have opened this year, bringing the town’s Wine on 49 tally — and our opportunities to go wine-tasting near the inn — up to 11. There’s a new restaurant here, too.

Sidewalks may roll up a bit early in this town, but the Hotel Sutter restaurant and bar are still bustling on this Friday evening, as we emerge from the laid-back Cavana’s Pub & Grub across the street just after 8:30 p.m. Two years ago, Terri and Joe Cavana expanded from a small deli on Eureka Street to this cozy gastropub. A flying pig greets you at the door, ceiling fans circle lazily overhead and baseball flickers from the flatscreens. And in the bar area, wingback chairs and colorful couches await, perfect for lounging with a pint, a cocktail — a Sutter Mule, perhaps — or a glass of local wine.

For more travel coverage from the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond

follow us on Flipboard.
Pair your bacon-topped pub burger ($15) with a Yorba barbera, say, or a Le Mulet Rouge sauvignon blanc — both wineries have tasting rooms just steps away. And don’t miss Cavana’s Amador Po’Boy ($15), which nestles thick, smoky Swingle Meat Co’s bacon in a soft roll alongside peppers, mushrooms, melty cheese and a spicy sriracho mayo. The sandwich is big enough to share, and the bacon — the bacon! — is a local treasure, produced by an old-school butcher shop in nearby Jackson that bills itself as “the carnivore’s toy shop.”

We’re still full the next morning, but the B of our B&B includes almond waffles with lavender-peach compote and candied, peppery bacon and — aw, who could say no? Besides, a brisk waddle, er, walk lies just ahead. And we hear music.



The Amador Farmers Market brings artisans, farmers and flower growers to town every Saturday morning, wooing passersby with the sounds of a live band and the aromas wafting from an alfresco kitchen. On this particular day, Stanley’s Steakhouse chef KC Brown, who took over the kitchens at the National Hotel in Jackson last fall, is dishing up upscale riffs on the BLT theme, canapes topped with crispy pork belly and tomatoes.

Just down the street, the main drag brims with adorable shops — be sure to check out Heart & Soul, a home decor store that also offers Annie Sloan chalk paint and art workshops. And new and updated tasting rooms have joined an already stellar lineup that includes Bella Grace, Feist, Uphill, Scott Harvey and more.

Miller Wine Works has moved into the Sutter Creek Cheese Shoppe, which means all those lovely sips of Ruddy Bloom rosé, grenache blanc and zinfandel are accompanied by some incredible cheese pairings. Happy crowds fill the new 1850 tasting room, drawn by not just $5 tastings, but the prospect of sangria, flatbread noshes and a staffer, who rolls your glass of red on its side to aerate the wine — without spilling a drop. And up on the corner, you can taste primitivos, nebbiolo and syrah at the new Matthew Gibson Winery, which moved into the white cottage previously occupied by Sutter Creek Wine Tasting.

					
				

And then, perhaps a nap.

			Pitts: How Sen. Robert F. Kennedy reached out to people on the margins		

	
	

He went to Appalachia, supported Cesar Chavez and Martin Luther King, Jr. and knelt on a dirt floor in Mississippi to try to coax a starving baby.

      Miami Herald

It made my mother scream.

That’s what I remember. I had been lying dozy in bed, but at the sound of her, I scrambled into the living room. She was standing before the television watching an image of chaos in a hotel ballroom.

Although I grew up in the 1960s, very few of the signal events of that tumultuous decade managed to penetrate my childish, oblivious world. I have little firsthand memory of the Watts uprising, the 1968 Democratic convention, or the moon landing. But I remember the night, 50 years ago this week, when Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was shot.

I remember that scene in the ballroom. I remember a crude graphic on TV news showing where a bullet had entered his skull. I remember hearing that he had 11 children and feeling sorry for them that this had happened to their daddy.

But then, you tend to remember the things that make your mother cry.

In many ways, Bobby Kennedy was an unlikely figure for mom’s great grief, a slightly built rich man with an upper crust accent, sad eyes, a rabbity smile and that shaggy forelock he was forever sweeping off his forehead.

Because he was the runt of a rough-and-tumble clan, he was always obsessed with proving his toughness. So as a Senate lawyer, as a campaign manager for his brother Jack and as attorney general, Bobby was the unwavering scourge of communists, gangsters and anyone — he famously approved the wiretap of Martin Luther King, after all — he felt threatened his brother’s political fortunes.

					
				

Then Jack was killed.

In the five years between that tragedy and his own assassination in Los Angeles while running for president, a different Robert Kennedy emerged. He’s the one my mother mourned, the one whose example haunts this fractured political moment.

He’s the one who went to Bed-Stuy, Appalachia and other broken places politicians often do not go. He’s the one who went to California to join Cesar Chavez as he ended a 25-day hunger strike. He’s the one who went to the Mississippi Delta, knelt on a dirt floor and tried to coax a listless baby whose stomach was swollen by hunger.

He let those kinds of things get to him, let them trouble, shatter and remake him. He reached out to people living on the margins, and they reached back with such fervor that his aides had to physically anchor him to keep him from being pulled out of the car when he campaigned in certain places.

It turned out the tough guy had an instinct for the underdog and a deep, moral indignation over the unfair treatment that trapped them in their hoods and hollers, barely subsisting in the shadows of plenty. He saw their humanity. This, I think, even more than his opposition to the war in Vietnam, was what drew people like my mother.

There was in that last ragged campaign of his, this sense of the possible, of the new, of fundamental, systemic change. There was this sense of a more compassionate America waiting just below the horizon. There was, in a word, hope. Or as Rep. John Lewis, then a campaign aide, consoled himself in the grim weeks after Martin Luther King was murdered in Memphis: “At least we still have Bobby.”

Then Bobby was gone.

Fifty years later, as immigrant children are taken from their parents at the U.S. border, as the rich get richer while the poor work full-time jobs for part-time pay, as hatred flows from the top of our government, hope feels like a bygone relic of an outmoded age, like blood from a wound that never healed.

That night, Mom cried for a loss greater than she could have known. She mourned a good and decent man.

	Review: ‘Nintendo Labo — Toy-Con 3: Vehicle Kit’ finally gets into the gameplay

		
	Gieson Cacho
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 20, 2018 at 6:03 pm | UPDATED: September 26, 2018 at 10:08 am

					"Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 3 Vehicle Kit" is an advanced project that will test a builder's skills but the reward is a fun experience that lets players maneuver over land, sea and air. (Nintendo)
				

The first “Nintendo Labo” kits relied heavily on the novelty of making toys and the joy of discovering what they can do. When it comes to the play aspect of “Toy-Con 1: Variety Kit” and “Toy-Con 2: Robot Kit,” the games were more like tech demos rather than full-fledged experiences. They showed the potential for play, but the games offered were short and shallow.
For “Nintendo Labo — Toy-Con 3,” the video game maker turned to something both accessible and compelling — vehicles. With this iteration, making the toy-cons takes a backseat to playing with them.
The heart of that experience lies in two toy-cons. One is the key and the other is the pedal. Both are needed to operate the three vehicles that players must create: the car, the submarine and the plane.


Of the three, the car is the most difficult to put together, with seven steps that include multiple rubber bands, grommets and a string. The process takes about four hours or so. The submarine takes less time and is easier while the joystick for the plane is a breeze and can be finished under 90 minutes.
The magic of the design lies in the key, which is what houses the right Joy-Con that has the infrared sensor. Players insert it into each of the rides to make it work, just like with real vehicles. The sensor reads the reflective tape inside each toy-con and interprets the motion of the controller.
The other part of the equation is the pedal, which houses the left Joy-Con. It works like the real-life counterpart: pressing down on the pedal with the foot makes vehicles move forward. Letting up slows the vehicle down until it stops.
When the pedal is combined with the key and vehicle it creates the convincing feel of piloting a vehicle. Tilting the joystick left and right banks the plane in that direction. “Nintendo Labo — Toy-Con 3: Vehicle Kit” doesn’t make flying too complicated, so don’t expect to do loop-de-loops or Immelmann turns. Flying is natural, easy and the best way to explore the world quickly.
The submarine is more unusual, with the pedal propelling the vessel. Steering involves twisting the wheels on each side to rotate thrusters. It takes a while to figure out how to exactly control the vehicle, but that’s part of the magic in “Toy-Con 3: Vehicle Kit.” Mastering the novelty of the controls is a huge part of the fun.
The car is by far the most complicated ride, with two levers each on the left and right that control a rotator saw, bombs — for removing obstacles — the radio and the fuel hoses. It also has a simple gear shift that puts the car in reverse. Lastly, it has drawstring that activates a boost.
Players must switch back and forth among these three vehicles in the main mode of “Toy-Con 3: Vehicle Kit.” It’s essentially an open-world exploration game, in which players explore 10 distinct districts. They can fly, dive or drive around the world, but players have to keep in mind that they need fuel for their vehicle.
The car will be the main mode of transportation because it’s the only way players can refuel. They just go to a gas station and fill up. The plane is the most helpful because it can get into nearly any area and players can easily spot sites of interests. It also comes equipped with missiles that blast objects out of the way. The submarine specializes in underwater exploration and has a grappling hook that can rip apart cages and other objects.
Players will need all these tools and vehicles to complete eight missions in each zone. These tasks include finding a flag, assembling a snowman or uncovering three lost undersea treasures. Once players complete every objective, they’re given a gift that alters the gameplay for the car and also unlocks an additional mission, in which they have to find five stars scattered in each zone.
The gameplay is laid back and relaxing in a world that’s not visually impressive. Fortunately, it does have enough interesting nooks and crannies that make exploration worthwhile. The world, which is named after the player, is a essentially playground, where players can master the intricacies of the vehicles.
With enough compelling content, “Toy-Con 3” gives players more than enough reason to play and discover the potential of the kit, and it will keep them hooked on the game longer than the previous entries

President Donald Trump got played.

After all the hoopla and pageantry and Trump braggadocio at the Singapore summit, with Kim Jong Un standing alongside the U.S. president in front of thousands of journalists, the North Korean leader came out the winner.

Kim had already racked up points just by standing alongside the U.S. president as an equal, showered with Trump’s praise and transformed from pariah to international rock star. In recent weeks he was welcomed to Beijing and Seoul, and invited to Moscow. China and Russia have already started to loosen sanctions.

All this might have been an acceptable cost for achieving the U.S. goal: to get Kim to commit specifically to shedding his nuclear weapons within a reasonable time frame, in a verifiable fashion. But, on this, Trump failed big time: The joint statement that emerged from the summit included no such firm commitments, using vague language on denuclearization that is interpreted very differently by the two sides. “It does not meet the minimum requirements in terms of what we expected them to do,” Ambassador Joseph Y. Yun, the former special U.S. representative to North Korea, told CNN.

Instead, Trump made a huge concession up front – stopping joint U.S. military exercises with South Korea, a key tool for keeping pressure on the North. And he didn’t even inform the Seoul government beforehand, leaving it publicly grasping for information on U.S. intentions.

“I gave up nothing,” the president insisted in a news conference. He was clearly oblivious to the fact that he was playing into North Korea’s longtime game plan: to emerge as an internationally recognized state, recognized by America and the world — without surrendering all of its nukes.

Let’s look at what the president did give up.

					
				

In the run-up to the summit, U.S. and Korean negotiators were wrestling over whether North Korea would make a substantial pledge of denuclearization up front, including details of its nuclear program and a timeline for dismantling it.

But, going into the summit, the two sides could not even agree on a common definition of the term denuclearization.

“Our definition of denuclearization is they give up all their fissile material, facilities, nuclear material taken out, irrevocably and verifiably,” says Jung Pak, top Korea expert at the Brookings Institution and a former senior CIA Korea analyst.

The joint statement, however, contained only a vague commitment to “complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” – terminology favored by Pyongyang and Beijing. In North Korea’s interpretation, say North Korea experts, this means an end to the U.S. troop presence in South Korea and nuclear umbrella over that country and Japan – without any corresponding specifics on eliminating its own nuclear program.

By using this language – and ending joint exercises – Trump acceded to Kim’s game plan. He went even further, repeating his desire to pull U.S. troops out of Korea (although not immediately) and emphasizing his desire to save money by so doing. All this before North Korea makes any firm commitment to giving up its nuclear weapons and missile programs.

True, Kim has frozen his nuclear tests and missile tests – for now. And he has destroyed an already collapsing nuclear test site and promised Trump more on other sites. But none of this speaks to the onetime American demand that North Korean completely, irrevocably, and verifiably destroy its weapons.

Negotiations will now commence, but if the past is prologue, they could drag on for a very long time and never reach a firm conclusion. Meanwhile, U.S. leverage on North Korea is declining, as China and Russia start to loosen sanctions. A push for a formal peace between North and South Korea will weaken any future pressure. And Trump’s eagerness to halt joint military exercises – and remove U.S. troops – undermines U.S. leverage further.

This gives North Korea little reason to swiftly negotiate an end to its weapons program. After all, the U.S. president has told the world that Kim is “very smart” and “honorable” and “wants to do the right thing.” Trump even sloughed off questions at the news conference about North Korean forced labor camps where thousands are tortured and murdered, saying such things happen elsewhere.

How embarrassing it would be for Trump to resume insulting the great Korean leader. Much easier to insult a democratic prime minister like Justin Trudeau.

The irony here is that, contrary to Trump’s exaggerated claims, Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush got much more specific commitments from Pyongyang. In 1992, 1994, and 2005, the North Koreans pledged to eliminate all their nuclear weapons. They reneged.

When asked why he’d do better, Trump bragged: “This is a much different president.” Clearly this president believes his smarts will get results from North Korea, where previous presidents met failure.

Rewatching last year’s 27-point loss in Las Vegas gives Spartans ‘sick’ feeling all over again

By Darren Sabedra | dsabedra@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: September 11, 2018 at 10:00 am | UPDATED: September 11, 2018 at 2:26 pm




CONCORD — One year later, the video doesn’t look any better for De La Salle.

“I watched it about four times the last couple of days,” coach Justin Alumbaugh said. “It kind of makes me sick. It makes the players pretty sick, too. We didn’t compete how we should have.”

Bishop Gorman-Las Vegas — USA Today’s national champion in 2014, 2015 and 2016 — is no stranger to putting a hurt on teams and last year in the desert De La Salle was on the receiving end of the pain.

Gorman scored 21 points in the second quarter, erasing an early touchdown deficit, and went on to beat the Spartans 34-7.

With Goman visiting De La Salle on Friday night for a rematch, last year’s game — in all its misery — was mandatory viewing for the Spartans.

On that night, De La Salle lost Kairee Robinson to a concussion and faded after the star running back went down.

“First half we were moving the ball well, pretty consistently,” Alumbaugh said. “Then a fumble return for a touchdown, then we fumbled on a third-and-1. We didn’t make anybody miss on offense and then defensively we’d get them into third-and-8 and they’d complete a 50-yard pass because they’d break contain. We didn’t do a lot right. I thought when Kairee went down, we gave up.

“The first half and second half were two completely different halves, and that’s pretty disgraceful from my standpoint. That’s something we’re working to remedy.”

Just like last season, Gorman is 1-2 and De La Salle is undefeated as the teams prepare to meet.

					
				

Gorman opened this season with a 42-0 loss to reigning national champion Mater Dei-Santa Ana — it was 14-0 at halftime — and followed that with a 13-7 loss to Arizona power Centennial.

The Gaels ended the skid Friday, winning at home 31-21 over Orem-Utah.

“This is going to be a big redemption game for everyone that was here last year,” De La Salle tight end/defensive end Isaiah Foskey said. “We have to try to get that smell off of us. They have some good athletes. We need to contain them, limit them to what they can do.”

Gorman’s offense has yet to shift into high gear. The Gaels are averaging 84.6 yards per game rushing (2.7 per carry) and 199.6 yards per game passing.

Micah Bowens has thrown more than twice as many interceptions (five) as touchdowns (two).

But that’s probably indicative of the high level of competition Gorman has faced than its ability to rev up the engine.

For De La Salle, this matchup is still an opportunity to see where it stands at the midpoint of the regular season.

“You can’t hide behind the fact that they’re one of the best teams in the country,” Alumbaugh said. “They put it on us last year. So, yeah, this is a big measuring stick for where we are. We want to perform well Friday, for sure. It will give us a good understanding where we are.”

Linebacker/running back Henry To’oto’o hopes that understanding is nothing like last season’s Gorman result.

“Probably the worst feeling ever, going down there and losing,” he said. “Felt like we wasted a trip. They were stacked, too. They’re a great team. Kairee went down, and nobody was able to step up.”

						President Donald Trump and Senate candidate, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) address the crowd during a campaign rally at Freedom Hall on Monday in Johnson City, Tennessee.		
	
By The Washington Post | 
October 4, 2018 at 4:22 pm


By Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Sean Sullivan | Washington Post

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. – Jeanie Brakebill voted for President Donald Trump. But when a conservative canvasser showed up at the 63-year-old’s door here recently, she confided that she had grown tired of Trump’s confrontational brand of politics and was leaning toward voting Democratic in the upcoming midterm election.

“I would vote for Bredesen, to help out Tennessee – even if it means giving Democrats the majority in the Senate,” said Brakebill, referring to Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen.



The sentiment expressed by Brakebill and voters like her have raised fresh worries for Republicans in this deep red state, which overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016 but where voters remain divided just weeks before a midterm election that could determine which party controls the Senate.

Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R, is locked in a tight race against Bredesen, a popular former governor running on a moderate platform and a deep well of goodwill from his eight years in office. Recent polls show Republican voters in Tennessee and nationally are becoming more galvanized amid a bruising confirmation battle over Trump’s Supreme Court pick, but GOP strategists have been frustrated that Blackburn has not established a comfortable lead in the race to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R.

GOP groups are deploying their full arsenal. Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the conservative Koch network, on Wednesday announced a $2 million television ad campaign attacking Bredesen, on top of the $2.5 million it already spent on the race. The Senate Leadership Fund, the main Senate GOP super PAC, which spent $2.5 million on ads in the state so far, said it plans to spend roughly $3 million through the fall.

And Blackburn’s backers are banking that although some voters are souring on the president, vocal support from Trump will boost turnout among the GOP base. Trump made his second visit to the state Monday in support of Blackburn, telling a packed rally that “a vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for.”

The difficulty for Republicans stems in part from the unique politics of Tennessee, and the fact that Bredesen, who left office in 2011 but has remained a household name, kindles a nostalgia for less-divisive times. He is a pro-business politician more in the mold of Corker, a moderate Republican who has sparred with Trump, than is Blackburn, who is deeply conservative and one of the president’s most loyal backers.

“Tennessee has a reputation for being super Republican, super conservative, and it certainly is a red state, there’s no debate about that,” said John Geer, polling and political science expert and dean of the Vanderbilt University College of Arts and Science. “But I don’t think it’s quite as red as some people think.”

					
				

Rather than railing against Trump as other Democratic candidates have done nationally, Bredesen has praised some aspects of the president’s agenda, such as his efforts to strike down regulations on businesses.

Bredesen also has pledged to withhold support for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., whose name in this state is synonymous with liberal combativeness. The disavowal comes although Bredesen has received help from a Schumer-aligned group, Majority Forward, which has spent $3.6 million on television ads in Tennessee, with $2.7 million in reserve.

Conservatives have sought to remind voters that the careful balancing act Bredesen is attempting is more difficult in polarized Washington – a fact laid bare by the upheaval over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Bredesen has refused to say whether he would vote for or against Kavanaugh – one of the biggest questions facing moderate Senate Democrats.)

In an interview Wednesday, Bredesen demurred when asked his position on Kavanaugh. But he argued that, at age 74, he can be relied on to serve as an independent voice because he has no ambitions for higher office beyond the Senate. He said the fact that the race remains competitive is a sign that his centrist message is appealing to voters across the political spectrum.

“I’ve got to rally Democrats. I’ve got to persuade a bunch of independents . . . [and] business [minded] Republicans,” he said. “But I did it as governor, and I think quite successfully. The fact that this campaign is obviously very competitive right now is evidence to that.”

In Bredesen’s equivocation over Kavanaugh, Republicans seean opening to drive up support for Blackburn, who has said firmly that she would vote to confirm the federal judge. Blackburn declined an interview with The Washington Post.

“It’s not about Brett Kavanaugh, it’s about the raw power of the Democratic Party . . . the meanness the Democratic Party will go to, to put one of their own” on the Supreme Court, Brian Hornback, chair of the Center City GOP in Knoxville, said at a recent committee meeting at a local chain restaurant in Knoxville.

Still, this is not where Republicans had hoped to be – not in solid-red east Tennessee, and certainly not so close to Election Day. At a time when activists had hoped to be focusing more on voter turnout than on persuasion, they were contacting hundreds of voters every day in an area that has voted Republican since the Civil War.

The Supreme Court battle has helped move the needle toward Blackburn among Republican-leaning and independent voters who are tired of partisan bickering, said Tori Venable, the Tennessee state director for Americans for Prosperity, whose activists are working across the state to persuade voters. The group is not letting up, as the race remains competitive, she said.

Blackburn is touting her conservative bona fides and is attacking Bredesen’s past support for Hillary Clinton and other national Democrats. Her hardcore brand of conservatism – she says in her announcement video that she carries a gun in her purse – is fueling the Republican base, which believes Blackburn has fought for their values during her 16 years in the House.

“I get up every day and I go fight for five things: Faith, family, freedom, hope and opportunity,” Blackburn in a debate with Bredesen last week. “Tonight, what you saw was one who’s going to be a fighter for those things and individual freedoms, and one that is going to support bigger government and big-government solutions.”

The Republican strategy against Bredesen was encapsulated in an attack ad unveiled Wednesday that seeks to link him to prominent Democratic lawmakers in Washington and spur voters to envision a Democratic-controlled Senate.

“If Phil Bredesen wins, Dianne Feinstein picks your judges, Bernie Sanders runs the budget and Chuck Schumer runs everything,” says the narrator of the commercial from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as ominous music plays.

But tethering Bredesen to Washington Democrats has proved to be a challenging task. He has never served in Congress and has crafted a reputation at home that has been difficult for Republicans to pierce.

Bredesen’s affiliation with the Democratic Party is no doubt a dealbreaker for some GOP voters who are mindful that control of the Senate hangs in the balance – including some who think he was a decent governor.

“Bredesen was one of the best governors we ever had. Problem is, he’s a Democrat,” said David Singer, 85, a retired professor and Blackburn supporter, after eating breakfast at a cafe in Murfreesboro, about an hour south of Nashville. “I’m afraid of upsetting the balance between the Republicans’ and the Democrats’ hold on the Senate right now.”

But while Blackburn inspires the base, she is alienating some more-moderate Republicans who have grown weary of Trump’s brand of incendiary rhetoric and view her as an extension of the polarization in Washington.

Thomas Cigarran, the chairman of the Nashville Predators hockey team and a longtime GOP donor, said he and his Republican peers are supporting Bredesen because they view Blackburn as a “poster child” of an ideologue.

“Marsha is going to vote the party line. That’s it,” he said. “We have way too much of that already. There’s no indication in the 16 years that any change in her behavior would be forthcoming. She is who she is.”

Cigarran hosted a fundraiser at his Nashville home last week in support of Bredesen. About 40 of his 50 guests were Republicans who were similarly frustrated, he said.

Another challenge for Blackburn: the lukewarm reaction to her candidacy from Corker.

Earlier this year, Corker lavished praise on Bredesen – drawing concern from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who told Corker in a private conversation that he was not being helpful.

Asked Wednesday whether he had any plans to campaign for Blackburn, Corker said he had been to a rally and two fundraisers. He said that he will be out of the country next Monday but that his wife will attend an event for Blackburn that evening.

By Cicero Estrella | cestrella@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: June 8, 2018 at 10:58 am | UPDATED: June 9, 2018 at 9:55 am


The presidential pardon is to Donald Trump what the car giveaway is to Oprah.

If only he had a studio audience to which he can hand them out to one and all.

“You get a pardon! You get a pardon! You get a pardon!”

FILE – In this Nov. 2005 file photo, President Bush presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to boxer Muhammad Ali in the East Room of the White House. President Donald Trump said he is thinking “very seriously” about pardoning Muhammad Ali, even though the Supreme Court vacated the boxing champion’s conviction in 1971. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) 
The president has granted a number of high-profile pardons and commutations the past few weeks, and has even said he has the right to pardon himself for alleged possible transgressions that his lawyers say he didn’t commit.

On Friday, he seemed to be extending an olive branch to NFL players by asking them for recommendations on who should be pardoned. He also shared an idea of his own.

Trump wants to provide a posthumous pardon to boxing legend Muhammad Ali.

“He was not very popular then, his memory is very popular now,” Trump said at the White House before leaving for the G-7 summit in Canada. “I’m thinking about that very seriously.”

The response from Ali’s estate was a lukewarm thanks, but no thanks.

“We appreciate President Trump’s sentiment, but a pardon is unnecessary,” Ron Tweel, who has represented Ali and his family for decades, told NBC. “The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Muhammad Ali in a unanimous decision in 1971. There is no conviction from which a pardon is needed.”

					
				

In 1967, Ali was convicted of draft evasion and sentenced to five years in prison after he refused to report for induction in the Vietnam War. He was also stripped of his heavyweight title.

Ali, who had cited his Muslim faith and declared himself a conscientious objector, appealed the case.

“I’m not going ten thousand miles from home to help murder and burn another poor nation simply to continue the domination of white slave masters of the darker people the world over,” he said then. “This is the day when such evils must come to an end.”

In 1971 the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously overturned Ali’s conviction, finding that his conscientious objector status was valid.

Ali divided the nation. He was vilified by some who considered his actions un-American, and glorified by others for his stance on civil and human rights.

At the time of his death in June 2016, however, the 74-year-old Ali was widely hailed as a national hero.

“His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail,” President Barack Obama said then. “But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today.”

A year after Ali’s death, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began to kneel during the national anthem of NFL games. He said it was in protest of the oppression of people of color and with issues of police brutality against the African-American community.

“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told NFL.com. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”

Kaepernick, like Ali before him, split the nation. Many other NFL players joined him in protest.

This offseason, the NFL approved a new policy requiring players to stand during the national anthem. The only form of protest the league will allow is the permission of players to remain in the locker room during the performance of the song.

Trump was among the harshest critics of the protesting players.

“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a (expletive) off the field right now’? Out. He’s fired. He’s fired,” he once said during a rally.

Earlier this week, Trump canceled the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles’ scheduled visit to the White House. Supposedly only about 10 players were willing to attend the ceremony.

On Friday, Trump seemed to want to make nice with the players with his new favorite thing — the pardon.
“I’m going to ask all of those people to recommend to me, because that’s what they’re protesting, people that they think were unfairly treated by the justice system, ” Trump said “And I understand that. I’m going to ask them to recommend to me people that were unfairly treated — friends of theirs, or people that they know about — I’m going to take a look at those applications, and if I find, and my committee finds, that they’re unfairly treated, we will pardon them, or at least let them out.”

It’s official, dude. California’s state sport is surfing.

Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday signed the legislation into law. For a state that brought the world the Beach Boys, Gidget and the wetsuit, elevating the iconic California pass time to an official state sport is well, pretty gnarly, if you ask around at some of the local surf shops.

“It’s a big deal for locals,” said Isaac Gonzalez, 18, who works at the Santa Cruz Surf Shop. Surfing “is something they grew up on, spent their lives doing and are passionate about.”

Surfers Tony Rose, left, 41, of Pacifica, and Jesse Quay, 38, of Oakland, head back in after surfing at Martins Beach in Half Moon Bay in 2014. San Mateo County Superior Court judge on Wednesday. (John Green/Bay Area News Group file photo) 
Unlike the the years-long fight between Santa Cruz and Huntington Beach over the moniker “Surf City USA,” there was little debate about making surfing the official state sport (except for those skateboard-loving outliers.)

“It just unifies the state,” Gonzalez said. “There’s no debate no more.”

The bill, authored by state Rep. Al Muratsuchi, a Torrance Democrat, notes that the Golden State is home to world-famous surf spots Malibu, Trestles, Mavericks, Rincon, Steamer Lane and Huntington as well as the Surfers’ Hall of Fame, the International Surfing Museum, and the California Surf Museum. And let’s not forget that Santa Cruz was home to the late Jack O’Neill, who pioneered the Neoprene wetsuit.

At O’Neil Surf Shop in Santa Cruz, clerk Autumn Knapp, 22, says the company founder would be stoked.

“He would love it,” she said. “I also think he would feel proud. He’s the one that invented the wetsuit and made it possible for so many people to surf longer and stay in the water longer.”

The official designation also boosts the state image, she said, and can help draw more people into the sport.

					
				

“Surfers are tan, they are beautiful, they are athletic,” she said. “Everybody loves a surfer.”

Here is a shortlist of some of California’s 35 official symbols and emblems

Amphibian: California red-legged frog

Animal: California grizzly bear

Bird: California valley quail

Colors: Blue and gold

Dance: West Coast swing dance

Fabric: denim

Fish: California golden trout

Flower: Golden poppy

Folk Dance: square dance

Gold Rush ghost town: Bodie

Insect: California dogface butterfly

Marine Reptile: Pacific leatherback sea turtle

Pet: shelter pet

Soil: San Joaquin Soil

Theater: Pasadena Playhouse

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

The poor kid.
Here he was, having a good ol’ time at last night’s Super Bowl Game, enjoying the half-time show, when singer Justin Timberlake had to drop by and ruin his life.

In the brief exchange between the crooner and a guy now known forever as “The Super Bowl selfie kid,” an embarrassing legacy of Biblical proportions was launched. As Timberlake kept pressing the kid – later identified as 13-year-old Ryan McKenna – to take a selfie of the two of them in the middle of a song-and-dance number, the poor guy fumbled with his phone while millions of viewers looked on, cringing.

In the wake of that moment, a million memes were born online, many of them making fun of the kid for, well, for not having his act together.

Check some of the jokes, including some that imagine what McKenna was so intently typing into his phone:

						Visitors look at the so-called corpse flower, known for the rotten stench it releases when it blooms, at the Huntington Library on Friday in San Marino.

Associated Press

SAN MARINO — Visitors were flocking to the Huntington Library in Southern California on Friday to get a whiff of a so-called corpse flower, known for the rotten stench it releases when it blooms.

The flower, nicknamed “Stink,” began blooming unexpectedly on Thursday night, Huntington spokeswoman Lisa Blackburn said.

“We thought we had a few more days to go. But it was ready and it was pretty spectacular,” she said.

Corpse flowers typically take 15 years to reach a mature blooming size, and blooms usually only last 24 hours.

The foul odor the plants emit attracts insects for pollination. The plants don’t emit the foul odor until they bloom.

“Stink” is the sixth corpse flower to bloom at the institution in suburban San Marino. The last was on Aug. 23, 2014.

The plant is one of the three corpse flowers expected to bloom within the next week. The two other flowers, nicknamed “Stunk” and “Stank,” should bloom in the next few days, Blackburn said.

The Huntington is seeing more visitors than normal because of the flowers, she said.

					
				

“The great thing about these flowers is they’re so unusual-looking and have this reputation for smelling really bad, it gets all kinds of people really interested in botanical science,” she said. “It’s just a charismatic plant.”

By Seung Lee | slee@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: June 15, 2018 at 11:05 am | UPDATED: June 15, 2018 at 2:58 pm


Startups founded by black women in the United States received a huge influx of venture capital in 2017 of nearly $250 million, more than quintupling the total amount they received in 2016, according to a report this week.

The report — published by digitalundivided, an Atlanta-based organization geared toward advancing equity in tech — highlights the progress black women startup founders made since the organization started tracking data in 2009 but says there is still a “long way to go.”

Since 2009, black women-led startups have raised $289 million total in venture/angel funding — the vast majority of which came in 2017. But compared to other Silicon Valley hotshots, $289 million is a mere drop in the bucket; Lime, the fast-growing dockless bicycle-sharing service, received $320 million in 2018 alone.

Black women-led startups received .0006 percent of the $424.7 billion in total tech venture funding raised since 2009, according to digitalundivided. Female startup founders in general did not fare well, receiving only 2.2 percent of venture capital in 2017, according to Fortune.

“The VC community has been looking for a certain pattern of a founder based on what has been successful in the past,” said Kathryn Finney, founder and managing director of digitalundivided, to Pitchbook. “If you’ve never invested in a black women founder, how do you know that founder isn’t going to be successful?”

The number of black women startup founders who raised more than $1 million increased in 2017 from 12 to 34, according to the survey. And notably, black women with non-STEM undergraduate or graduate degrees were able to raise 2.5 times as much on average as those with STEM degrees.

California and New York by far were the two biggest hot spots for black women startup founders. The two states accounted for nearly half of all the startups, according to the survey.

California-based black women startup founders raised a total of $125.94 million of the $289 million — more than 43 percent. In contrast, black women startup founders in 36 states did not raise a single dollar.

			The Federal Communications Commission told a federal court on Thursday that it acted properly when it repealed the U.S. government's net neutrality rules in 2017, marking its first legal salvo in a campaign to battle back 22 states and tech companies including Mozilla, Facebook and Google that contend the agency's move was illegal.

The third game of the preseason is often referred to as the “dress rehearsal, as traditionally, a team’s starters play a bit longer than they usually do in the preseason — sometimes even a whole half — as a warm-up for the regular season. 

 
Friday’s Raiders-Packers game was not a dress rehearsal. 

Because if it was, then the show should be canceled before it opens. 

The Raiders’ 13-6 win wasn’t much of a football game and it provided little entertainment to boot. It was a truly unpalatable affair that featured two poor offensive lines, terrible quarterback play, shambolic special teams, and flags. 

So, so many flags. 

An “excruciating” amount of flags, per Raiders head coach Jon Gruden. 

 

Ultimately some of the soul-crushing terribleness was by design — neither team took the exhibition contest seriously (Aaron Rodgers and a slew of top Packers players did not suit up) — but that doesn’t give us back those interminable three-plus hours of our lives. 

					
				

Alas, the regular season starts in two weeks — we should try to find value amid the undeniable ennui. 

So here’s what we learned in the Raiders’ third preseason game: 



Jon Gruden isn’t telling us a damn thing

(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) 
Earlier this week, I wrote about how the Raiders are the NFL’s biggest mystery. Even though there was a whole, 60-minute “game” on Friday night, nothing has changed since I posted that column. 

I said it then and I’m repeating it now: Gruden isn’t just playing his cards close to the vest — the cards are under the vest and a few other layers of clothing. He doesn’t want you to even know he has cards. 

There’s validity to that strategy — particularly when the NFL schedules your first-round opponent as a preseason foe (what the hell was the league thinking?) — but Gruden has really taken it to the next level. 

As such, after three preseason games, we have little idea of what Gruden’s offense is going to look like in 2018. 

There are a few breadcrumbs — the Raiders are going to zone block (more on that in a moment) and I think they’ll use 21 (a fullback and one tight end) and 22 (a fullback and two tight ends) personnel often — but Gruden’s offensive play calling has been aggressively vanilla. The Raiders’ are running a high school — or Todd Downing — offense right now, and while I carry plenty of skepticism towards all things, including Gruden, I’m going to give the Raiders’ old/new coach the benefit of the doubt on this one: he’s not going to tell us a damn thing about his offense — the one he’s theoretically been developing in the lab for the last decade — until the season opens on Monday Night Football, Sept. 10. 

Of course, with Friday’s game being the third preseason affair, Raiders quarterback Derek Carr entered the contest with the expectation that he would play most of the first half — if not all of it. 

With No. 4 under center, I thought we’d find a few more breadcrumbs. If the starting quarterback plays multiple series, it’d be impossible to not get a few more hints, right? 

Well, that question still remains — Carr played one series and was pulled. 

To be fair, it was a solid series that started with a 49-yard pass to Amari Cooper and was highlighted by a nice third-down conversion deep in Green Bay territory, but those plays didn’t tell us much of anything about Gruden’s offense.

“There isn’t much more for me to see. The battle for us is who is behind Derek,” Gruden said after the game. “I wanted to get Connor [Cook] first team all offensive line for a couple series. But we have a pretty good idea who our starters are on offense. I was really pleased with Derek on how he started the game.” 

And on the other hand… 



The Raiders don’t have a viable backup quarterback (what’s new?)

Connor Cook (Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) 
My intrepid colleague Matt Schneidman asked Gruden after the game if Carr’s backup was already on the roster. 

The Raiders coach didn’t say yes. 

That should tell you everything you need to know about how poorly Connor Cook and EJ Manuel played against the Packers. 

Cook looked to have the inside track to the backup job — presuming the Raiders only carry two quarterbacks on their roster — after a solid performance in the Raiders’ first preseason game. That advantage was fully squandered on Friday. 

Cook looked absolutely overwhelmed by a Packers defense that was mostly comprised of second and third-string players. He couldn’t execute basic NFL passes — even when he had time to throw. It was painful to watch, and he finished the game 6-for-15 for 72 yards and one interception. He should have had two interceptions to his name — he was bailed out by a flag — and frankly, his yardage is inflated by a play he didn’t make — a 26-yard Jalen Richard bubble screen. 

All in all, an abysmal evening.

Manuel played in the second half and while his stats looked better (8-of-12 for 87 yards) and he did drive the Raiders to the game-winning touchdown against a Packers’ defense comprised of guys who will be free agents this time next week, truth be told, he didn’t do anything to endear himself to the coaching staff or fans on Friday. His best plays were probably scrambles and there were a couple of throws that were downright head-scratching.

Also, he lost a fumble for the third straight preseason game, which has to be some sort of record. 

The duo’s combined futility demanded the question Matt asked. I’m fascinated to see if Gruden has a better answer — or if he takes action — in the coming days. 

We know he likes Cook, but there’s no way that the Raiders coach can have any confidence in the Michigan State product’s ability to win a regular-season game if Carr goes down. And while, I was surprised that Manuel was even re-signed this past offseason, and he’s clearly not the answer, even if he’s arguably a better option. 

I understand that you don’t practice “f—ed” but conceding games — which is what the Raiders would be doing if either of these quarterbacks is named Carr’s backup — isn’t much of a strategy, either. 

So where do the Raiders go? 

The better question might be “when do they go?” 

The longer the Raiders wait, the more tied they become to the options already in-house. That said, the currently available options at aren’t tremendous. Matt Moore might be the cream of the crop. (For those who will, logically, suggest that Colin Kaepernick should be called, I doubt the NFL, which is effectively a co-owner of the Raiders these days after they helped facilitate Vegas stadium financing for the team would be thrilled with such a move. Even though Kap is the best quarterback available and the Raiders of old wouldn’t hesitate to bring in such a firebrand, it’s likely a non-starter.)

Perhaps the Raiders could swing a trade for Jets backup Teddy Bridgewater, but I doubt Gruden would want to give up an asset of any serious value for a backup quarterback at this juncture in the preseason. 

Beyond that, is it worth waiting until after the fourth preseason game to land a recently cut quarterback like Chad Henne, Matt McGloin, Kevin Hogan, or Tyler Bray? 

Well, after Friday’s game, it’s impossible not to say yes. 

There’s plenty of interesting things going on in Alameda, but the backup quarterback job might be at the top of the list in the coming week. It’s a tricky scenario. What Gruden does will be telling. 



The offensive line is in rough shape

Maybe I shouldn’t be so hard on the backup quarterbacks — after all, they were playing behind abysmal offensive lines on Friday. 

Yes, what was once perceived as the Raiders’ strength is now an unmissable problem. 

The first-string offensive line — with rookie Kolton Miller at left tackle and Donald Penn at right — had a rough going. The second-string looked just as porous. 

The latter part — that’s not all that unexpected. They’re second-stringers for a reason. 

The former part, though? Even though some growing pains are to be expected with a rookie left tackle, Penn shifting to the right side, and a new scheme being installed, I’m not sure it should be this painful. 

Penn, in particular, was noticeable for all the wrong reasons Friday. He looks more than a step behind his teammates and certainly opposing pass rushers, and he was completely worked in what proved to be Carr’s final snap of the game. But it wasn’t an isolated incident — a few plays before allowing a drive-killing sack, he had whiffed on a cut block. All this to say that the transition is clearly not going well, and while Penn’s a pro who deserves the benefit of the doubt, the possibility still exists that a shift to right tackle and this scheme might be too much for him.

When asked about Penn after the game, Gruden spun the performance as a positive. That, of course, was him standing up for a veteran who has sacrificed money and accepted a move away from his left tackle position with grace. 

“He played pretty well. He had one snap today where he was power rushed. I am going to watch

the tape before I make too many specific comments. It is a work in progress. He has been out for a long time. Doing rehab on the side with the trainers is one thing and coming out in these games and blocking rushers is another. He has ways to go before getting back to being 100 percent, but we do appreciate his hard work,” Gruden said. 

On the other side of the line, Miller didn’t fare much better. If not for Penn’s poor play, Miller probably would have been the focus of the o-line concern — Penn’s guy barely beat Miller’s mark to the quarterback on a few plays Friday. 

Both tackles look ok in the run game — Miller, with his athleticism, is clearly the prototype of a zone-blocking tackle and Penn is a road grader — but pass protection is perhaps the most important thing to the Raiders in 2018, given Carr’s propensity to be skittish in the pocket, and we’re going to go into Week One without truly knowing if the Raiders can protect the quarterback on passing downs. 

Don’t worry though, the Rams — the Raiders’ Week One opponent — don’t have one of the best defenses in the NFL… 

Oh, wait. 



Gruden must be seeing something in Doug Martin the rest of us are missing

(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) 
Keeping it with the offense, Gruden gave free agent pickup Doug Martin some solid run at running back Friday — it was somewhat a dress rehearsal for the former Buccaneer — and… I still don’t get it. 

It’s preseason. It’s important to not put much stock in the preseason — it’s not real NFL football — but Gruden has given Martin rave reviews since he signed him and heading into the final week of preseason, I’m still waiting to see what the Raiders’ head coach is talking about. 

Martin carried the ball four times for 24 yards on Friday. There was a 16-yard run, but other than that, the memory I will have of Martin’s game was him running directly into a pile of dude at the line of scrimmage over and over again. He doesn’t look — in any way — to be a game breaker. 

Now, Gruden sees Martin every day — maybe the Stockton kid still has pop. I just haven’t seen it and with a nice stable of running backs (Chris Warren and Jalen Richard were both really good on Friday), one has to wonder what Martin’s role on this team is. 

Alas, like most things, we probably won’t be able to say anything definitively until after Week One. 



Arden Key has a chance to be a star — and that’s a factor in the Khalil Mack “negotiations”

Arden Key (99)(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) 
There are a lot of things holding up the Khalil Mack contract talks and no one has a definitive answer as to what is going on with the Raiders and their star pass rusher. 

What we do know is that there isn’t much of a negotiation happening right now. My understanding is that the Raiders have not extended a fair-market deal (see: one as good as Von Miller’s six-year, $114 million deal) to Mack and his representatives yet. 

There seem to be several reasons behind that, though the weight of each varies based on who you talk to. 

The first is that the Aaron Donald situation — despite what some might say — is absolutely a factor. It’s becoming evident that Mack and the Raiders are both waiting for Donald and the Rams to set a market price. They are certainly closer to a deal down south than Mack and the Raiders are, so perhaps that roadblock will be cleared soon. 

Another issue is the fact that Gruden — an offensive-minded head coach — is in charge of the roster and he may not be completely convinced that a pass rusher is worth “quarterback money”. It’s easy to see how that could offend his sensibilities. 

Add in the fact that if Mack is given “quarterback money”, he and Carr could eating up to a third of the Raiders’ salary cap space for next year, with 51 other roster spots to fill. That kind of commitment makes it difficult for Gruden to build the kind of veteran-filled roster he wants. 

Mack is due $13.8 million this season — that’s the value of the fifth-and-final-year option on his rookie deal. Mack won’t necessarily become a free agent when that contract expires, though, as the Raiders can franchise tag him for an estimated $18 million. 

If they wanted to franchise tag him for a second year in 2020, he’d make an estimated $21 million. Another franchise tag in 2021 would be around $30 million — they wouldn’t take it that far, I’d imagine — but it’s certainly not a preposterous number for one of the NFL’s best players. 

And while it makes sense for the Raiders to sign Mack to a long-term deal to smooth out his cap hits — franchise tag money is all guaranteed and counts 100 percent against the cap — there is value in year-to-year dealings. 

There are a ton of similarities to LeVeon Bell in Pittsburgh with this Mack situation — a disconnect between the market value and the team’s perceived value — and that’s why the sense is becoming that Mack will not get a new deal and will end up being franchise tagged in 2019. 

[I cannot verify the popular theory that Davis cannot put Mack’s entire signing bonus into escrow, creating a critical problem in giving him a fair-market contract, but of the people I trust to know if such a thing is happening (which is, admittedly, a small list of people) no one has told me that is definitively not the case.] 

Another reason a Mack deal does not seem imminent — Arden Key. 

The Raiders’ defensive line has looked fantastic this preseason, even without Mack (the venerable Jerry McDonald broke that down Friday night as only he can), and Key, in limited game action, looks every bit like the top-10 talent he was billed as heading into the 2017 college season.

It was suggested to me earlier this week that while Mack is irreplaceable, Key has impressed so much in practices that there’s a sense that the pass rush would still be solid if the All-Pro holds out well into the regular season. 

In short: the Raiders are getting such solid play from Mack’s backups that they’re not feeling the pressure to get No. 52 back into the fold. 

That logic can be stretched out into 2019 and beyond, too. Again, Mack cannot be replaced, one-for-one, but this team might be able to recreate a solid chunk of his production for a fraction of the cost — and isn’t that the strategy of the modern, team-driven NFL? 

Key’s cap hit is $3.4 million… total, over the next four years. Less than a million per year for that kind of talent is a steal. Add in a solid interior pass rush, Bruce Irvin (due $8 million this season and $9 million next year), and a couple of backups who have looked good in the preseason in Shilique Calhoun ($630k deal for 2018) and Fadol Brown (due $480k in 2018), the Raiders would be in good shape without one of the NFL’s best players. 

The Raiders’ ability to say that they don’t need Mack to be successful on defense in 2018 and beyond — something that’s not entirely laughable these days — gives Gruden and company complete control of any negotiations. A pass rusher, no matter how good he might be, simply isn’t as irreplaceable as a franchise-caliber quarterback and the Raiders are proving it right now. 

Add in the threat of a franchise tag and it’s hard to see the Raiders giving Mack a “quarterback” contract anytime soon.

By Harry Harris | hharris@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: May 26, 2017 at 3:02 pm | UPDATED: May 26, 2017 at 3:56 pm


RICHMOND — A 21-year-old man was shot to death Thursday night in central Richmond, police said.

He was identified as Trevon Macdonald of Richmond.

Police said the shooting happened about 7 p.m. near the 100 block of 20th Street.

Before officers arrived, police were notified Macdonald had been driven by someone to Kaiser Hospital, where he died.

Lt. Felix Tan said police  are investigating what led to the shooting and what the motive was. No arrests have been made.

The killing is the sixth homicide investigated by Richmond police this year.

Anyone with information about the killing is asked to call Detective L. Caston at  510-620-6622.

	This cover image released by Hachette Books shows “Commander In Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump,” by Rick Reilly. (Hachette Books via AP) NEW YORK — The next book to take on President Donald Trump isn’t focused on Russia or tax policy. It’s about his golf game.

Hachette Books announced Wednesday that Rick Reilly’s “Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump” will come out next May. Hachette is calling the book a close study of Trump’s “ethics deficit” on the course and what it says about him as a leader. Reilly is a longtime contributor to Sports Illustrated and CNN. He’s basing his book on firsthand observations, along with interviews with everyone from golfing partners to caddies.


Reilly has written about Trump and golf before, notably in his 2003 publication, “Who’s Your Caddy?: Looping for the Great, Near Great, and Reprobates of Golf.”

By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: October 1, 2018 at 12:36 pm | UPDATED: October 2, 2018 at 2:36 pm


Not only did Bay Area coding platform GitHub give a former legal executive lower compensation because of her ethnicity and gender, it altered her stellar performance review to justify firing her, she claimed in a lawsuit.

Agnes Pak, who said in the suit that she worked as a top attorney at GitHub from February 2017 until her termination in April, alleged that because she’s a woman of Korean descent, she received a lower signing bonus and salary, and fewer stock options, than other senior GitHub executives with less experience and career seniority.

GitHub, used by 24 million software developers last year and headquartered in San Francisco, said in a statement, “The allegations are without merit, and we look forward to defending ourselves through the legal process.” Github is currently in the process of being acquired by Microsoft in a $7.5 billion deal.



Pak claimed in her suit that after taking on the duties of GitHub’s male Hispanic chief legal officer following his promotion, Pak was paid less than he was for doing the same work. She also did work similar to that of a female, Jewish legal executive, who had little to no experience with several areas of corporate law, but Pak received fewer stock options than the woman, Pak alleged in the suit filed Friday in San Francisco County Superior Court.

Once she learned her compensation was lower than she believed it should be, she complained to a superior, and believed the matter was being addressed, she claimed. She also complained to the company’s human resources department and to members of her team, she said in the suit. Meanwhile, she received an annual performance review in April that gave her the highest-possible rating, and consequently received the highest-possible raise and a “generous” bonus, she claimed.



But she was soon fired, with a superior — the Hispanic former chief legal officer — citing her “unprofessional” complaints about compensation, she alleged.

After she was sacked, she asked for and received her employment file, which contained a performance review with a lower rating than the one she had originally been given, and the review included performance issues that hadn’t been raised during her review meeting, she claimed. She alleged that her review had been changed, “to create a false justification for her termination.”

Pak is seeking at least $20 million in stock options, and an equal amount in damages.

						India’s left behind: Millions in Mumbai still live in desperate poverty		
	
By Dai Sugano | dsugano@bayareanewsgroup.com | 
PUBLISHED: December 31, 2008 at 7:51 am | UPDATED: August 14, 2016 at 2:40 am


Mercury News Staff Writer John Boudreau and I spent nearly a month in India last year working on a series of articles about that country’s economic boom and extensive ties to Silicon Valley.

India’s rising prosperity is a remarkable story. Millions of people have been lifted from poverty in recent years. But the new glitter of India’s cities can’t hide the grim reality that remains daily life for hundreds of millions of its citizens.

About one-third of the world’s poor people live in India. More than 450 million Indians exist on less than $1.25 a day, according to the World Bank.

More than 6 million of those desperately poor Indians live in Mumbai, representing about half the residents of the nation’s financial hub. They dwell in gigantic slums and roadside shanties that press up against the shimmering high-rises that serve as the most conspicuous symbols of India’s new affluence.

These photos show what that other Mumbai — the one still waiting for prosperity — looks like up close.

Inside Dharavi, one of the city’s mega-slums, I watched a child play with a kite on a windy day. The scene looked normal, except that his playground was an enormous pile of garbage.

At another slum, I watched mothers and children with grimy hands pick through wet mounds of rubbish. They fended off starvation by recycling scraps of metal and plastic, earning less than a dollar a day.

Some of the most poignant moments of my tour of the slums escaped capture by my camera lens and exist only in my memory. 

As I sat in the back of my hired car at a busy traffic light one morning, a little girl — probably 5 or 6, just a few years older than my son — approached and put her hand to her mouth over and over, pleading in a tiny voice for money to buy food. I quickly gave her some change but felt too overwhelmed by her misery to point my camera at her face.

					
				

As I sit in the newsroom writing these words, some of my memories from India already have started to fade. But the image of that little girl is seared into my mind. It remains as sharp as the gritty details in these photos of her world.

	Hanson: The American art of renewal

		
	Victor Davis Hanson
	  
	PUBLISHED: August 3, 2018 at 6:49 am | UPDATED: August 3, 2018 at 6:49 am

					Less than two years into Trump's presidency, the economy achieved 4 percent growth in the second quarter of 2018.
				

“Make America Great Again” is the oft-caricatured slogan of the Donald Trump presidency. When Trump was elected, he boasted of jump-starting the economy to achieve an annual economic growth rate of 4 percent.
Experts laughed him off as a naïf who did not understand that structural changes in demography and technology made such growth impossible. Many economists predicted that Trump would crash the stock and job markets.
Yet less than two years into Trump’s presidency, the economy achieved 4 percent growth in the second quarter of 2018. Unemployment rates are at near-record lows. The stock market and oil and gas production are reaching unprecedented heights.


Such radical turnarounds have been common in U.S. history. As the ancient Athenian historian Thucydides noted, large democracies are by nature volatile, they can mobilize quickly, and they can change on a dime — sometimes in the right direction.
In late 1983, Ronald Reagan was being written off a practitioner of voodoo economics. The country was still mired in a recession caused by Reagan’s efforts to break runaway inflation.
In the 1982 midterm elections, Republicans lost 27 seats in the House and one in the Senate. The man likely to be Reagan’s Democratic rival two years later, Walter Mondale, was considered a good bet to win the presidency, given his youthful vigor, his prior service as vice president and his incorruptibility.
Yet in the 12 months from November 1983 to the 1984 election, the economy grew at an astonishing quarterly rate of better than 7 percent. Unemployment dropped. Almost every economic indicator showed an unprecedented boom.
Mondale went down to defeat in one of the largest Electoral College landslides in U.S. history, largely because the economy had been reinvented almost overnight from a bust to a boom.
In 1940, Depression-era America was recovering from yet another downturn. The New Deal had not restored prosperity after the 1929 crash. Europe was largely under the control of Nazi Germany. Only the United Kingdom was left of the European democracies that had fought Hitler. The Soviet Union was aiding Hitler. Imperial Japan was preparing to gobble up most of the Pacific, especially orphaned European colonies rich in oil, rubber, agriculture and precious metals.
The United Sates was torn apart politically between isolationists and interventionists. Fights broke out in Congress over whether the country could afford to rearm. The U.S. Army was smaller than Portugal’s. In almost every area of armament, America was far behind the armed forces of the Axis powers.
Then the world again flipped upside down. After Pearl Harbor, the United States engineered the greatest economic expansion in history. Within four years, the U.S. economy was greater than that of all its enemies and allies put together.
The U.S. Navy had become larger than all the navies of the world combined by 1944. A once virtually unarmed America now had more military aircraft that Germany, Italy and Japan combined.
A war that in early 1942 looked like it might either go on for years or end in an Axis victory was over less than four years after the U.S. entered the conflict. The Axis powers were not so much defeated as ruined.
World War II was not the first instance of a rapid American turnaround in wartime. In the summer of 1864, pessimists warned that the North could not win the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln faced opposition for the Republican Party nomination, and even if he earned it, he was considered likely to lose the November election to Union General George McClellan.
General Grant’s Army of the Potomac was being bled white in Virginia in vain attempts to dislodge Robert E. Lee’s defenders from their entrenchments around the Confederate capital of Richmond. Gruesome encounters such as the Battle of Cold Harbor and the Battle of the Wilderness had given the depressed Northern public nightmares.
Then, suddenly, fantasy became reality. The maverick Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman unexpectedly took Atlanta on Sept. 2, 1864. Euphoria swept the North. McClellan’s sure-thing candidacy crashed.
The mercurial Sherman then headed off with his huge army on the famous “March to the Sea” through Georgia. He next plowed through the Carolinas to the rear of Lee’s army in Virginia.
In less than nine months the entire Confederate cause collapsed. The supposedly endless Civil War ended with a sudden and absolute Union victory that no one had foreseen.
Pundits should be careful with their sure-thing predictions, especially in the matter of a powerful, unpredictable and explosive America. With the risk-taking and unconventional Trump, and the hysterical opposition to him, we are entering another unpredictable and volatile era in American history.
Radical and unexpected economic recovery can happen at home and abroad. Such fundamental change in the status quo can swing the November election — quickly and in unforeseen ways.

By Laylan Connelly | Southern California News Group
PUBLISHED: March 2, 2017 at 12:52 pm | UPDATED: March 2, 2017 at 1:22 pm


Screen grabs from video by Mike Hefner taken of anglers pulling up a baby great white shark at the Huntington Beach pier. 
Mike Hefner just wanted to grab a bite to eat while on his way to Hollywood.

The South Carolina tourist thought Ruby’s at the end of the Huntington Beach Pier sounded like a good place to stop, but after finding that the restaurant was closed, he continued his leisurely stroll back down the long pier.

That’s when a commotion stopped him in his tracks – anglers wrestling to pull a 6-foot shark from the water, something Hefner had never seen before. Like others who had gathered around as people cheered, he pulled out his phone and recorded video.

Hefner had no idea he was entering a firestorm of debate surrounding the capture of great white sharks. Since his video was posted on Facebook Feb. 21, it has generated more than 300,000 views and garnered news coverage around the country.

“Someone caught something, so I stayed and watched,” Hefner said via e-mail. “I’ve seen sharks caught on other piers in different states, but this was my first time seeing a great white. By reading the comments on my Facebook, I guess it’s illegal to pull a great white out of the water. The guys could have easily cut their line and let it go, but they decided to try to net it and then when that failed, they used a gaff hook in its gill to pull it onto the pier.”
Despite the public’s assumptions, California Department of Fish and Game spokesman Andrew Hughan said it hasn’t yet been determined to be a great white.

“There are many sharks that look similar,” he said. “I would ask the public to be patient. We are working diligently, investigations take time. Just because everybody says its a white shark, doesn’t mean it’s a white shark. We are very well trained and experienced and we’re wildlife experts, but this isn’t ‘CSI,’ we can’t determine things overnight.”

The Register first reported the video Saturday, and since then, it has appeared on Fox, NBC and across local media outlets from Hefner’s hometown of Myrtle Beach.

The comments on social media show mixed response to the incident. The video showed the shark hitting a concrete pier pillar as it was pulled up toward the deck, with people surrounding it and appearing to be posing for selfies. Some argue the incident was not just illegal, but also cruel. Others say a flurry of great white activity off the coast represents a healthy ecosystem and they should be legal to catch.

					
				

Hefner wrote that he had “a couple of people threatening me to take it down.”

Lifeguards worry anglers catching great whites off the pier can cause them to be agitated and attack nearby surfers and other ocean users, similar to an incident that happened a few years ago in Manhattan Beach when a swimmer was bitten after anglers snagged a great white. But lifeguards have no authority to enforce fishing laws on piers, which is regulated by Fish and Game.

State law protects the great white from being caught off California. Hughan said it’s a misdemeanor to capture a great white, and if those in the video are convicted, they likely would not face jail time or the maximum penalty of $10,000.

“If they were convicted, the Orange County judge would decide the penalty. It depends on the charge and how the judge feels about it,” he said. “In reality, no one is going to jail.”

In the video, one person is yelling “pull, pull, pull” as anglers with heavy fishing gear pull the baby great white toward the crowd. Cheers ring out as the shark’s 6-foot-long body is pulled upward.

“Hey, take a picture fast,” one man screams.

“They threw it back over the pier and as far as I know it lived,” Hefner wrote. “Once they threw it over, I left and continued my journey to Hollywood.”

Lifeguards are concerned with the number of great white shark incidents in recent weeks – this was the third recent catch off the Huntington Beach Pier. In the other two instances, the sharks were released back into the water, so there were no fines imposed.

An angler’s catch off Sunset Beach went viral when an 8-foot great white was caught from shore, but the shark was quickly returned to the ocean after the fisherman realized what he had captured. Also, a 12-foot great white was spotted by a police helicopter and a two-mile stretch of beach was shut down.

			It would advance the administration's agenda of establishing American "energy dominance" on the world stage and underscores a willingness to intervene in markets to make that happen. It's also tantamount to an end-run around West Coast officials who have rejected private-sector efforts to build new coal ports in their states.

PUBLISHED: December 14, 2017 at 10:32 am | UPDATED: December 15, 2017 at 11:41 pm


HALF MOON BAY — The big-wave surf contest at famed break Mavericks has received approval from various government agencies and will be held between Jan. 3 and Feb. 28, the World Surf League announced Thursday.

The WSL is running the event for the first time after taking over the contest from Titans of Mavericks owner Griffin Guess, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year. The new operator has renamed the event the Mavericks Challenge.

The almost two-month gives organizers the best opportunity to run the contest on a day with big waves and blue sky. The Big Wave Tour only runs events when surf reaches at least 30 feet. Competitors are given 72 hours’ notice to get to the event.

Some of the Bay Area’s top big-wave riders earned invitations in the 24-surfer men’s field, including Tyler Fox, Nic Lamb, Peter Mel and Anthony Tashnick, of Santa Cruz;  Pat Shaughnessy, of Scotts Valley; Travis Payne, of Pacifica; Jason Stark, of Montara; and Ben Andrews, of San Francisco.

Also, Bianca Valenti, of San Francisco, and Sarah Gerhardt, of Santa Cruz, got berths for the historic women’s division that features six of the world’s best big-wave riders. 

Others big names included are Grant Baker, of South Africa, Greg Long, of San Clemente, and Hawaiians Jamie Mitchell and Keala Kennelly.

The Mavericks contest wasn’t held last season in the midst of financial issues, although the coast had a spectacular winter of surfing.

The contest has changed organizers throughout the years and has struggled to grow because of a lack of sponsorship. The WSL paid about a half-million dollars to take over. Officials said it will be part of the Big Wave tour through 2021.

This year’s contest will include a one-heat women’s competition for the first time, but Sabrina Brennan of the San Mateo Harbor District commission asked fellow commissioners to not issue an event permit beyond this season unless World Surf League officials include a multi-heat women’s division. 

					
				

“Going forward it is my hope that all Harbor District special use permits and event permits will prioritize gender equity as an enforceable requirement,” Brennan wrote in a letter to the commissioners this week.

WSL chief executive Sophie Goldschmidt said in a statement that a women’s event has been a priority since acquiring the event. The last contest was held in 2016, won by Lamb, who called the break “the crown jewel of Big Wave surfing and the tour. It’s the only California big-wave venue on the tour and perhaps the most feared. I’m excited at the direction we’re headed. It was only a matter of time for the women.”

Jeff Clark, who helped put Mavericks on the map as one of the world’s most punishing and awe-inspiring big-wave breaks, organized the first contest in 1999. Since then, 10 events have been held at the break just off Pillar Point in Princeton-by-the-Sea.

The Mavericks Challenge will form part of the 2017-18 Northern Hemisphere season, according to the World Surf League. The event will include a men’s field comprising the top 10 finishers of the 2016-17 Big Wave Tour, six event wild cards, three Big Wave Tour wild cards, one injury wildcard and the top four Surfline overall Performance of the Year award recipients. The women’s roster was selected by the WSL commissioner’s office and a local Mavericks committee.

“It’s going to be an amazing opportunity to see another big-wave spot, one of the best in the world, and have an empty lineup with the best surfers, best conditions and the best waves,” Paige Alms, 2016 women’s Big Wave champion, said in a statement. 

The 2017-18 tour has completed its first two events with Hawaiians Kai Lenny winning the Puerto Escondido Challenge in Mexico and Ian Walsh and Alms finishing first at the Pe’ahi Challenge in Maui.

PUBLISHED: September 10, 2018 at 3:08 pm | UPDATED: September 11, 2018 at 9:43 am


By Cindy Dampier

I came home from work recently to find that Gwyneth Paltrow had let herself in. She looked relaxed: Her long blond hair fell in loose waves, and her soft-looking khaki green jumpsuit was cropped to reveal that she had kicked off her shoes. I like people who make themselves at home. Still, it was a little disconcerting to see her there, grinning at me from the front of my (typically human-free) CB2 catalog, which arrived sometime in the first few days of September. I shouldn’t have been surprised — though she’s no longer working as an actress, Paltrow remains more ubiquitous than in her movie star days.

Just after she popped up at my house hawking furniture, her company, Goop, percolated back to the top of the news feed for paying $145,000 in civil penalties when an investigation by the California Food, Drug and Medical Devices Task Force found that claims on the Goop website were misleading consumers. Three products were found to have been falsely advertised: the Inner Judge Flower Essence Blend, which was touted to keep depression at bay, and two stone eggs (one quartz, one jade) designed to be placed in the vagina. The eggs are still for sale on the Goop website, for $55 and $65 each, but claims that they regulate menstrual cycles and treat incontinence have been replaced with talk of chakras and a stern instruction to use as directed. Goop has claimed no liability, calling the case an “honest disagreement.”

Critics have likened Paltrow to a modern-day snake-oil salesman, pointing to these claims and others on the site. And she has long been considered part of a list of unlikable celebrities. But that hasn’t stopped her brand from spreading like a virus.

Why? “Perceptions of a person are always different from the perceptions of the product,” says psychologist Peter Noel Murray, whose work centers on consumer behavior. “Gwyneth Paltrow has got this background that is pampered and privileged and whatever, and she’s kooky, and she’s out of the mainstream. People who buy this stuff, they respond to those things. It gives meaning to their lives.” Murray points out that, even though we often don’t realize it, we buy things that match our own emotions.

Thus, Goop customers might respond to Paltrow’s brand not by thinking that they are following trends dictated by a celebrity, but that they are tapping into an iconoclastic streak in themselves.

“They’ll think of themselves as individuals,” says Murray. “They walk a different path. Or they are people who maybe are not individuals, but they want to be perceived as individuals. That’s what makes the whole luxury market work, is how it affects who we want to be.”

Paltrow also serves another handy retail function, says Northwestern University marketing professor Tim Calkins: “Celebrity brands bring differentiation. When there are many choices, the celebrity brand stands out.” In other words, in a world with thousands of berry red lipsticks, she helps us choose the Vapour Beauty Aura Multi-Use Stain. And thus, having made inroads into our medicine cabinets, kitchens (“chip clips just got a whole lot chicer”) and closets (“not your typical turtleneck”), it’s only natural that Paltrow would have plans for the rest of the house.

She has worked with sought-after design firm Roman and Williams, who designed the first Goop brick-and-mortar store, in a space in a Santa Monica shopping mall that Paltrow remembers as a childhood favorite candy store, and her New York penthouse, which featured a sofa-sized swing in the living room. She also tried out well-known designer Windsor Smith’s Room in a Box concept, redesigning her Amagansett living room with the designer for a Goop feature.

					
				

These environments, it should be said, have little to do with the kind of regular-apartment, easy-to-acquire furniture sold at CB2. Say what you will about the democratization of design: Pieces similar to the sculptural coffee table chosen for Paltrow’s redesigned Windsor Smith room go for around $50,000. Which would buy you about 179 of CB2’s best-selling waterfall acrylic coffee tables.

The divide between her own lifestyle and the lifestyle of pretty much everyone else hasn’t stopped Paltrow from extending her grasp into the mass market, and it shouldn’t, says Murray. “Those people who see themselves as consistent with her products exist in all demographic segments” he says, “so it’s just as valid for a mass market as it is for a luxury one.”

The best parallel, he says, is the woman who came first to the better-than-your-lifestyle market: Martha Stewart, who has taken an openly dismissive tone vis-a-vis Paltrow. They have more in common than either would like to admit. “Look what Martha did,” says Murray. “When she first came out, she was perceived to be elitist, and she crossed over to the mass market. The next thing you know, she was at Home Depot.”

In fact, I was once asked to meet Martha Stewart for an interview at the Home Depot store on North Avenue. She was wearing leather pants and rudely turned up her nose at the lavish catered snacks that had been laid out for her, which I hoped the store employees would get to eat later. Still, I sometimes look through her organizational products in the closet aisle when I pass through the store.

“She’s a good example that there are no boundaries, and you are what you make of yourself in that world,” says Murray.

This is obviously not lost on CB2. “We’re excited about the Goop x CB2 collection,” CB2 President Ryan Turf said in a statement, calling the pieces “elegant, yet laid back.” The description is not off base, though the prices are not as laid-back as CB2 buyers are used to.

Flipping through the catalog, I wasn’t sure whether I would like what I saw — honestly, I was sort of rooting against Paltrow. She, like Martha, has a difficult persona that leaves you feeling you’re hanging around with an ill-wishing friend. Her life is nicer than yours, OK, but she’s also not afraid to let you know that it’s your own fault. Though I find her endorsements more a cause for skepticism than a cause to buy, my bottom line wavers because, I’m a little embarrassed to admit, some of the products are really nice looking. Paltrow, like Martha, has style — or knows where to acquire it.
Luckily, furniture is not a miracle-working wellness potion — it succeeds or fails mainly on appearance. CB2’s Goop offerings include a handsome dining table with an interesting shape, dining chairs that echo 1960s Italian design, and an upholstered barrel chair that I could covet — would that shearling (very splurge-y for CB2 at a $3,299 price point) look good in the living room? I wasn’t sure how the chair’s emotional content matched my own emotions. (Mainly, I was wondering whether, if you bought the chair, you’d need to carefully rip all labels off of it, so that you could more convincingly pretend it was not one of those Goop chairs.) Then I noticed the one detail that evoked a clear response: The chair is named the Gwyneth. Perfect — it’s not for me.

Peninsula/South Bay
Gabriel Reclusado, Piedmont Hills
Sport: Football


Class: Senior
Position: Quarterback
Reclusado was nearly unstoppable in the Pirates’ 48-41 win over previously undefeated Live Oak. He completed 19 of his 23 passes for 274 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions (a 160.1 quarterback rating). He also rushed for 191 yards and two touchdowns in the victory for Piedmont Hills (2-4, 2-1 Blossom Valley Athletic League Mt. Hamilton Division).
Sarah Perry, Woodside
Sport: Cross country

During the Artichoke Invitational, held on a 2.3-mile course at Half Moon Bay High, Perry finished 24 seconds ahead of freshman teammate Elle Marsyla and crossed the finish line in 14:27 to claim first place in the Large School Varsity Girls division. Despite the 1-2 finish for the Wildcats, it turned out Menlo-Atherton edged out Woodside by a point in the team standings — 43 to 44.

He also found the end zone a third time on a 33-yard interception return and deflected a trio of passes in the secondary.

By Peter Hegarty | phegarty@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: October 8, 2018 at 1:30 pm | UPDATED: October 9, 2018 at 10:05 pm


OAKLAND — Many of those pop-up restaurants that have sprung up all over — mostly under the radar — will be considered legal in Alameda County next month.

The county will have new rules by then that officials hope will clarify what the temporary restaurants are allowed to do and comply with upcoming changes in state regulations.

Though pop-ups have operated throughout the county for years, it’s unknown how many exist. Still, it was a surprise to many when a county health inspector in August abruptly shut down Nokni, a 3-year-old pop-up inside Oakland’s Kebabery, just as operators Julya Shin and Steve Joo were cooking dinner.

The restaurant on Market Street was closed for the day and the inspector issued Nokni a cease-and-desist notice.

The action, which stunned fans of the pair’s Korean food, underscored that Alameda County had no rules for pop-ups, despite their popularity.

It prompted supervisors to hold a Sept. 10 hearing that culminated with them allowing pop-ups to resume operating until code enforcement could be reviewed and new rules drafted.

“The problem is that the food industry has developed so quickly,” Supervisor Wilma Chan said, noting that state law has not kept pace with the variety of ways people now dine out. “That leaves cities and counties with their own policies and regulations.”

Joo said in an interview Monday he wants more details about what the county is putting in place but looks forward to working with officials on reopening his pop-up, which he has held at about 10 locations at various times.

“It’s a step in the right direction,” Joo said.

					
				

Pop-ups emerged during the 2008 economic recession, when struggling chefs, looking for places to offer meals, ended up hosting events without permits inside established restaurants.

Some cooks also opened food trucks, while others took part in the underground food scene, which can be entirely outside the law where news about events is spread via social media.

Pop-ups will be allowed within facilities that have Alameda County permits to serve food, but the places must sign off with the county as being a “host facility,” according to the new rules.

The host restaurants will be required to ensure at least one person certified in food safety is present while the pop-up is operating, food preparation areas and restrooms are clean and alcohol is served by someone with a license from the state’s Alcoholic Beverage Control.

The new rules were outlined to the county board of supervisors’ health committee on Monday.

Under the rules, pop-up operators must apply for a permit through the Alameda County Environmental Health Department and pay a fee; the amount was not disclosed Monday because it had not yet been established.

Meanwhile, beginning in January, state regulations will include tweaked definitions of a catering operation and updated requirements for food handling and safety.

San Francisco currently has a pop-up enforcement program and Contra Costa County regulates them as caterers under the state retail food code.

Ron Browder, director of Alameda County’s environmental health department, said much of the time between now and enactment of the new rules next month will be spent training the county’s 18 inspectors on enforcement.

“There will be lots of things to do by then,” he said. “But that is our goal.”

Fans of specialty espresso drinks know that sugar and cream are coffee magic. They erase the bitter notes and turn bold, rich coffee into a dreamy liquid dessert. It’s no surprise that ice cream makers are taking a cue from that.

The combination of cream, sugar and coffee in frozen form is so delicious that scores of new twists on coffee ice cream are showing up in freezer sections, including cold brew, Columbian coffee, and Vietnamese and Turkish-style coffees, and some embellished with bits of chocolate, swirls of fudge and more.

We took a sweet, eye-opening taste adventure through a stack of specialty pints in every coffee variation we could find. Great coffee ice cream starts with bold, expertly brewed, high-quality coffee. The results should be creamy, rich and pleasantly sweet, with coffee as the first and last flavor on your palate. Texture is entirely negotiable, as some of the best flavored versions are grainy due to tasty coffee grounds or espresso fudge in the mix, while others are more like ice milk.

As delicious as coffee ice cream can be, more than a few things can go wrong. Some are so creamy, they taste like marshmallow. Others lack — ahem — coffee flavor. And the worst are sugary bites of nothingness, nonetheless packed with sugar, fat and calories.

Here’s the buzz on the best coffee ice creams and the blandest bores. Nutrition details are based on ½-cup servings.

McConnell’s Turkish Coffee

This crazy-tasty ice cream, blended with crushed espresso beans, offers powerful flavors. It’s heaven for picky drinkers, who want only the very best cup of coffee. Those sensitive to caffeine should resist this as an evening treat. 260 calories, 19 g fat, 18 g protein. $7.99 a pint at Raley’s. (4 stars)

Ben & Jerry’s Coffee Coffee BuzzBuzzBuzz!

Chunks of grainy espresso-bean fudge tucked into rich, velvety coffee ice cream makes for an impressive double-punch of flavor. 250 calories, 16 g fat, 24 g sugar. $4.99 for a pint at Safeway. (4 stars)

Tillamook Stumptown Cold Brew Coffee Ice Cream

Fans of ultra-creamy ice creams will fall for this luxurious, bold coffee version. This is a great pick for an elegant dessert. 210 calories, 14 g fat, 19 g sugar. $5.19 (on sale for $3.50) for 15.5 ounces at Raley’s. (4 stars)

Three Twins Milk Coffee

Huge coffee flavor and the light, fresh texture of ice milk make this an irresistible spoonful. 200 calories, 13 g fat, 17 g sugar. $4.99 for a pint at Safeway. (3½ stars)

					
				

Vice Cream Higher Grounds

This decadent bite is highlighted by crispy cookie bits and a swirl of mocha fudge. The coffee flavor is pleasant, if a bit overshadowed by the chocolate. 280 calories, 14 g fat, 24 g sugar. $5.49 for a pint at Safeway. (3 stars)

So Delicious Cold Brew Coffee

Thumbs-up for minimal sugar and fresh, bold coffee flavor in this coconut milk-based treat, but this ice cream is definitely a coconut-coffee flavor experience. 150 calories, 8 g fat, 15 g sugar. $6.49 per pint at Whole Foods. (3 stars)

O Organics Mochaccino

Great coffee flavor and a pleasant level of sweetness yield tasty results, although the coffee bean bits are too big and chewy. 210 calories, 13 g fat, 19 g sugar. $4.99 for a pint at Safeway. (2½ stars)

New Barn Organic AlmondCreme Organic Coffee Bean

Those who can’t have cow’s milk may enjoy this deep brown mix with coffee bean flecks, but the almond flavor quashes the coffee. 170 calories, 7 g fat, 15 g sugar. $6.99 for 14 ounces at Safeway. (1½ stars)

Humphry Slocombe Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee

Those who don’t care much for coffee should opt for this chicory-root version. The ultra-fresh cream is a win, but it doesn’t taste like coffee. 170 calories, 10 g fat, 17 g sugar. $8.99 for a pint at Whole Foods. (1½ stars)

Safeway Signature Reserve Colombian Cold Brew Caramel

This icy, uber-sweet mix has the bitter finish found in black coffee, but it lacks the nutty note of well made, good-quality coffee.  220 calories, 16 g fat, 26 g sugar. $4.99 for 14 ounces. (1½ stars)

Haagen Dazs Coffee Ice Cream

Coffee is clearly an afterthought here. It’s certainly edible, but ultimately disappointing with barely-detectible coffee flavor. 240 calories, 16 g fat, 20 g sugar. $4.99 for 14 ounces at Whole Foods. (1 star)

Straus Family Creamery Organic Coffee

Made with decaf coffee, this extremely creamy, marshmallow-like mix has a fruity note, but it fails to deliver more than a hint of coffee flavor. 240 calories, 15 g fat, 19 g sugar. $5.19 for a pint at Raley’s. (1 star)

						Richmond BART station reopened after nearby brush fire		
	
By Aaron Davis | aarondavis@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group
PUBLISHED: August 18, 2018 at 3:04 pm | UPDATED: August 19, 2018 at 3:39 am


UPDATE: The Richmond station was reopened as of 3:17 p.m.

RICHMOND — The Richmond BART station closed after a brush fire broke out near the station early Saturday afternoon.

Richmond firefighters initially were called out to the single alarm fire at 2:04 p.m. The brush fire burned approximately one-quarter of an acre in a field east of the BART tracks near 19th Street and MacDonald Ave. The fire extended into a BART track area, but was under control in 30 minutes, according to the Richmond Fire Department.

BART released an advisory at 2:16 p.m. that the Richmond station was closed due to a brush fire. An advisory issued at 3:17 p.m. announced that normal service was restored to the station but that there is a major delay on the Richmond line at the Warm Springs, Richmond and Millbrae directions.


Stn closure at RICH stn due to a brush fire.  trains will not travel past DELN stn. Parallel bus svc is available via a/c transit bus #72m

— SFBARTalert (@SFBARTalert) August 18, 2018




Trains originating from Warm Springs will only go to the El Cerrito Del Norte station. Trains originating from Millbrae were only traveling as far north as North Berkeley. Riders hoping to connect to these stations can present their BART card to take the 72m AC Transit bus.

A small grass fire broke out on Crestview Drive in Richmond at 1:55 p.m. There were no injuries or damage associated with the fire, which was put out in 10 minutes, according to a Contra Costa Fire Department official. A bystander reported seeing kids in a field nearby playing with some fireworks, according to Steve Aubert, a spokesperson for ConFire.

The mysterious phone call came as Raj Jayadev left the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice after yet another day helping families of criminal defendants navigate the often intimidating labyrinth of the court system.

			MacArthur ‘genius grants’: Full 2018 list		

			
	


“The first thing they said was, ‘Are you alone?’ ” recalled the co-founder and longtime director of San Jose-based Silicon Valley De-Bug. “Whenever someone says that, you want to say, ‘You got the wrong number.’ ”
It was an inauspicious greeting for Jayadev, given he’s one of the South Bay’s most outspoken critics of the criminal-justice system that he’s made his mission to reform.



The caller, however, was from the MacArthur Foundation, letting him know he was one of the year’s 25 recipients of its prestigious fellowship, commonly known as a “Genius Grant.” He was chosen for his work in community organizing, particularly in helping pioneer “participatory defense” — credited with helping families with few resources and public defenders increase their chances of winning their cases, or at least reducing their sentences.



The grant, which comes by way of secret nomination, pays Jayadev $625,000 over five years. The award is famous for its “no-strings attached” status, meaning the money can be spent continuing De-Bug’s work in any way he and the group see fit.

Previous MacArthur fellows — who have been recognized since 1981 for promoting innovation and creativity from the sciences to public policy to journalism and the arts — include renowned Stanford professor and social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt, and famed playwright and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Like many recipients before him, Jayadev said the award came as a complete surprise. His instinct was to credit the dozens of staff and volunteers who have buoyed De-Bug since he helped found the organization in 2001, initially as an urban ethnic news magazine, just a few years after graduating from UCLA.

“The first thing that ran through my head, I have to tell the people who really won this award,” he said. “The way I see the award, it’s a recognition of a community journey.”

(Courtesy of John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation) 
Jayadev was referring in part to the numerous family members of arrested people who came to the De-Bug office just outside downtown San Jose, desperately looking for help and revealing the void for a much-needed service.

“All it really was is families sitting around the (office) table, saying, ‘My loved one has court next Wednesday, what do we do?’ ” he said. “We didn’t invent anything. We took the ethos and organizing IQ that families and communities already have, and layered it over a court system that by design is this isolating experience.”

Perhaps the most visible and recognized form of that advocacy is Jayadev and his organization’s promotion of the participatory defense model, the centerpiece of the Albert Cobarrubias Justice Project named after a De-Bug leader and aspiring defense lawyer who was shot and killed in San Jose in 2010.

De-Bug staff have spread the practice across the country, training similar social-justice groups in how to act as a court resource for those who often have no one to turn to but an often overworked public defender. Jayadev happened to be in Seattle doing that same kind of work when talking about the MacArthur award on the eve of its public announcement Thursday.

So far, De-Bug has helped cultivate 21 participatory defense “hubs” in cities including San Diego, New York, Philadelphia, Knoxville and Nashville. In all, they estimate they have shaved 4,000 years’ worth off potential prison time for their clients.

Santa Clara County has been an incubator for the practice, and attorneys with the Public Defender’s Office often refer defendants’ families to De-Bug staff and volunteers who sit in the back of arraignment court. Relatives are asked to fill out an initial form with background information such as a defendant’s job, family status, and criminal history, so that the defense attorneys have some basis to argue against high bail or for supervised release.

Jayadev’s “racial and social justice leadership is unique and powerful, and our partnership with De-Bug in working to humanize our clients through participatory defense, has grown and strengthened the last several years with many positive outcomes,” Santa Clara County Public Defender Molly O’Neal said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing to work with him in the future.”

De-Bug also helped pioneer “visual advocacy” — videos aimed at humanizing defendants presented at sentencing, and which advocates contend have resulted in reduced prison time.

Deputy public defender Avi Singh has often gotten a front-row seat to the dramatic effect that participatory defense can instill.

“The challenge they’ve figured out over a decade is how we can help people in this criminal-justice system by giving them a voice through knowledge and also bringing the intelligence of the community to a case. Where a person is from, what they’ve been through. Rich information that isn’t in the case file,” Singh said. “It decreases isolation and increases hope. It really matters when you’re representing a person with community ties, with them coming to court, and not re-offending.”

Over the years, De-Bug has routinely supported and counseled families of people killed in police encounters, and recently has heavily advocated for bail reform, arguing that it unfairly punishes poor people and communities of color. They initially co-sponsored Senate Bill 10, which eliminated cash bail in the state, but later pulled their support when the bill was re-written, then eventually signed by Gov. Jerry Brown.

They contended the changes replaced one problematic money-stained system with another that put jailing decisions almost entirely in the hands of judges, skewing against the same groups they intended to help.



But for Jayadev, even as he looks over the past two decades, progress and success for the organization is still rooted in watching people walk into De-Bug’s self-described funky office and join their impromptu family, which includes his wife Charisse Domingo, with whom he has a 7-year-old son.

“De-Bug has always been a place where people get to exercise the values they espouse or say they believe in, and you get to test it too,” he said. “Some of these principles and beliefs can have real impact on the trajectory of people’s lives.”

	Kurtenbach: Alright, C.J. Beathard — prove me wrong

		
	Dieter Kurtenbach
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 24, 2018 at 2:26 pm | UPDATED: September 25, 2018 at 3:33 am

Jimmy Garoppolo is out for the season with a torn ACL in his left knee, and that means that the 49ers need a new starting quarterback.
C.J. Beathard, the stage is yours.
Yes, the former Iowa quarterback will likely be the 49ers’ starter at the most important position in football for the final 13 games this season. And if you’re someone, like myself, who suffered through the first 11 games of the Niners’ 2017 season, it’s fair to presume that this year’s team is screwed.


In fact, if I was a 49ers fan, I’d start watching a lot of college football — Cal and Stanford are both ranked and I hear it’s a good draft year for pass rushers.
(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Beathard started five games for the Niners last year, posting numbers that were worse than the not-so-venerable trio of Jay Cutler, Brian Hoyer, and Josh McCown. He was the 31st best quarterback in 2017, per FootballOutsiders’ DVOA statistics.
Beathard is a quarterback whose most appreciable skill last year was his ability to get repeatedly hit. This is a guy who was so bad in the 2018 preseason that the 49ers probably should have cut him.
And with that guy at the helm, the 49ers — who, don’t forget, started last season 0-9 — are going to be hard-pressed to get five more wins in 2018 and match last year’s Garoppolo-lifted 6-10 record.
No, I’m not even close to optimistic that Beathard can follow in the footsteps of Nick Foles, Kurt Warner, Jim Plunkett, Earl Morrall, Doug Williams, Jeff Hostetler, or Tom Brady — quarterbacks who started the season as backups, got a chance to play, and helped lead their teams to Super Bowl victories.
But wouldn’t it be a hell of a story if he came even close to that level?
While I have never been wrong about anything pertaining to sports — ever — I hold out some hope that Beathard makes me look like a fool over the remainder of the 2018 season.
Everyone loves an underdog, after all — even me.
(Jose Carlos Fajardo/Bay Area News Group) That said, it’s improtant to emphasize that it’s not a good situation in Santa Clara — and while I have little confidence that Beathard can salvage the Niners’ season, I do think that Kyle Shanahan would be wise to give him the vast majority of playing time in the final 13 games. (I’d like to see Nick Mullens get a chance in December because — presumably — at that point, why not give the kid an NFL start?)
The 2018 season is only three games deep, but the 49ers had done little (I’m using the past tense for obvious reasons) to inspire at the start of the campaign — even with Garoppolo (who was lacking the magic pixie dust he was drenched in last season) at quarterback, the Niners didn’t look like a playoff team. There’s simply not enough talent on this roster.
So play Beathard, take your licks, and get a bunch of high draft picks in April.
This team isn’t making the playoffs, so there’s no good reason to sign a quarterback who can actually help you win games — all you’d be doing is messing up your draft position.
You know, like Garoppolo did last year.
Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) Jimmy G made it easy to forget just how bad this team was before he showed up and somehow plugged all the team’s gaps at the end of the season.
Garoppolo was transcendent — truly, honestly transcendent — for the 2017 49ers and that’s why the team committed to paying him upwards of $40 million this season.
But remember, Beathard had the chance to do the same thing last year — he was the guy that Garoppolo replaced, after all — and again, his top quality was that he was an excellent crash-test dummy.
I’ve seen this movie before and it’s just not very good.
(AP Photo/Michael Perez) In fact, Beathard’s “touchdown” throw on fourth-and-7 late in Sunday’s game against the Chiefs might legitimately be the best ball I’ve seen him deliver in red and gold.
Perhaps that’s the kind of quarterback play that we can expect from No. 3 in year two.
There are positives to be gleaned, after all: This is a guy who had an expected completion percentage 10 points higher than his actual completion percentage last season, and it’s not as if he wasn’t pushing the ball downfield (7.4 air yards per pass attempt in 2017). Perhaps Shanahan — who defied all conventional wisdom to select Beathard in the 2017 NFL Draft — was right all along. Perhaps Beathard, a year older and wiser, will look like a smooth operator of Shanahan’s offense. Maybe the offensive upgrades the Niners made since last year — Alfred Morris, Weston Richburg, Mike McGlinchey — and Beathard’s maturation combine to create something special in Santa Clara.
There’s a chance. I’d love for it to happen — it’d make the 49ers relevant and not a dead team walking.
But I’m not betting on it.
The stage is yours, C.J. — make me look like a fool.

‘Sonny’ Leyland Trio to perform at Summerset

BRENTWOOD — Summersest Orchards in Brentwood presents the music of the Carl “Sonny” Leyland Trio at 7 p.m. Sept. 13.

Leyland, a pianist since childhood, was born and raised in the south of England. He came to the New Orleans in 1988 where he performed both solo and with many groups, and eventually moved to Southern California in 1997.

Leyland’s very convincing singing of the blues and his ability to play so many genres of music make him one of today’s most exciting pianists. The other two members of the trio are also lifetime pianists, in addition to their expertise on the bass and drums

Tickets are $15 and may be purchased at the door the evening of the performance. Summerset Orchards is at 770 Centennial Place in Brentwood. Doors open at 6 p.m., with seating at 6:30 p.m. For questions or more information, call 925-513-2640.

Pittsburg troupe to open ‘Fiddler on the Roof’

PITTSBURG — Pittsburg Community Theatre opens its 43rd season with the beloved musical “Fiddler on the Roof,” Sept. 16-25 at the California Theatre.

“Fiddler on the Roof” tells the story of Russian villagers and their universal longings — love, wealth, freedom, God and home and boasts the beloved songs “If I Were a Rich Man,” “Sunrise, Sunset,” “Matchmaker” and more. Dance into the town of Anatevka, where “Tradition” is both embraced and challenged as local milkman Tevye (James “Jim” Coniglio) sees his daughters fall in love in a time of extraordinary change. Fiddler on the Roof features music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, book by Joseph Stein which is based on Sholom Aleichem stories by special permission of Arnold Perl.  

Tevye tries to maintain his family and Jewish religious traditions while outside influences encroach upon their lives. The strong-willed actions of his three older daughters — Tzeitel (Lena Timrott), Hodel (Alicia Nicole Andreatta-Jacques) and Chava (Elizabeth Martinie) — who choose their own husbands moves the family further away from the customs of his faith. Choosing “love” over “tradition” makes Tevye wonder if his wife Golde (Bobbie Barlow) loves him. Throughout all of this, Tevye must also deal with the edict of the czar that evicts the Jews from their dear little village of “Anatevka.”

This timeless story is directed by Steven W. Mergogey-Conti assisted by Keala Freitas with musical direction by Carille Bruno-Thayer. Original choreography reproduced by Alicia Nicole Andreatta-Jacques & Zia Tedford.  

Season tickets and individual tickets now available through the box office at the California Theatre.

Show dates Sept 16-25, with Friday and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays 2 p.m. matinees.

Tickets $10-$25

Call 925-427-1611 Tuesday through Friday from noon to 5 p.m. or go to www.pittsburgcaliforniatheatre.com.

Pittsburg to induct new arts hall-of-famers

PITTSBURG — Three Pittsburg musicians who toured with some of the 20th century’s most influential recording stars and local gospel legends will highlight the Pittsburg Entertainment & Arts Hall of Fame Induction Class of 2016.

Bassist Curtis Ohlson, who toured with Ray Charles and Buddy Rich, vocalist/keyboard player Rosie Gaines, part of Prince’s New Power Generation, and drummer Peter Riso, who toured with legendary jazz vibraphonist Cal Tjader, will be among the inductees at PEAHOF’s third Induction Ceremony at 2 p.m. Oct. 16 at the Creative Arts Building on the Pittsburg High School campus.

 The Anderson Sisters (Stella Rivers, Dorothy Stanton, Lillie Woods and Lois Anderson), a highly acclaimed gospel recording group that began singing at the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church and appeared with gospel legends Five Blind Boys of Alabama, Mighty Clouds of Joy, Dixie Hummingbirds and the Caravans, will join Ozeal Woods, First Baptist Church minister of music for more than 50 years, and Zilfert Johnson, who has worked with a number of Pittsburg churches and was co-founder of the Pittsburg Community Choir, as inductees.

The induction class also includes Los Angeles Times columnist and author of “The Soloist,” Steve Lopez; artist and educator Luis Gutierrez; Terrence Brewer, considered the Bay Area’s top jazz guitarist; keyboard player extraordinaire Danny Daniels; Walt Hill, who revived the music scene in Pittsburg in the 1980s; and Chris Lanzafame, who has played in Pittsburg bands for many years.

“We are so pleased with the 2016 Induction Class,” said Theresa Jones, chair of the PEAHOF Induction Committee. “It again shows the diversity and depth of talented artists we have in Pittsburg in the fields of music, fine arts and literary arts.”

Tickets for the Induction Ceremony are $20 reserved and $10 general and are available at the PEAHOF website: pittsburgentertainmentandarts.org.

A reception dinner and after-party are also being planned.

	Jury convicts former Millbrae resident of child sex abuse

		
	Jason Green
	  
	PUBLISHED: September 11, 2018 at 10:20 pm | UPDATED: September 12, 2018 at 11:33 am

	REDWOOD CITY — A 62-year-old Utah man with Bay Area ties has been convicted of molesting a young female relative, and authorities are continuing to search for other victims.
Latu Lavaki On Monday, a San Mateo County Superior Court jury found Latu Lavaki, formerly of Millbrae, guilty on one count of felony lewd act with a child and one count of felony sexual penetration. The jury deadlocked on a third count of felony oral copulation on a child.
Lavaki faces up to eight years in prison when he returns to court for sentencing on Dec. 7.


The victim was 7 years old when Lavaki molested her at his Peninsula home during her 2006-07 winter break. According to prosecutors, she only disclosed what had happened after learning years later that he had allegedly molested her mother and aunts in the mid-80s.
Lavaki was extradited from Utah, where he had moved, to face charges in the more recent case. The statute of limitations had expired for the others, according to prosecutors.
On Tuesday, the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office announced it was looking for other victims.
“The molestation started in the mid-80s and the suspect victimized many girls over the past few decades,” the sheriff’s office said in a news release. “Unfortunately, with the statute of limitations for some of these crimes, we were unable to prosecute him on all the cases we know about. But we believe there are potentially more victims out there.”
Anyone with information can contact Detective Sgt. Joseph Cang at 650-363-4008 or jcang@smcgov.org.
Lavaki, who had been out of custody on $200,000 bail bond, has been remanded into custody.

PUBLISHED: July 19, 2018 at 7:51 am | UPDATED: July 19, 2018 at 7:59 am


Putin leads Team Russia–

who leads Team America?

Through the first 44 Presidents it was always assumed that our chief executive was the captain of Team America, the person who would stand up for us and represent us to the world.

President 45, however, apparently sees himself as a personal global power, somehow entitled to view the activities of all countries including our own from a lofty position of neutrality, not a team captain but a referee.

Unlike other leaders around the world who never say anything negative about their own governments or public officials, Trump feels free while on a world stage to disparage our entire intelligence community, attack a legitimate investigation as a witch hunt, and hold up our past flaws and failings as justification for Russia’s conduct.
